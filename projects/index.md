The **Sunil Abraham Project** documents, studies, and archives a range of open research and creative work. Documentation is central to this effort — it preserves knowledge, captures the process behind ideas, and makes insights accessible to others. By maintaining structured, open documentation, projects remain transparent, collaborative, and easy to extend.

## Current Projects

### Artificial Intelligence
A continuing study of ideas, reflections, and observations on Artificial Intelligence. The focus is not only on technology but also on the human, ethical, and creative dimensions of AI. Through writing and documentation, this project explores how AI transforms learning, work, and creativity.

## Future Projects

Further work will include research documentation, field notes, and essays on science, art, and digital culture.  
Each project will be written, refined, and published here — keeping the spirit of open knowledge alive.
