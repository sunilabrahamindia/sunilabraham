description: "Overview of ongoing and future projects under the Sunil Abraham Project, documenting open research, creative work, and reflections on technology, society, and culture."

The **Sunil Abraham Project** documents, studies, and archives a range of open research and creative work. Documentation is central to this effort — it preserves knowledge, captures the process behind ideas, and makes insights accessible to others. By maintaining structured, open documentation, projects remain transparent, extensible, and useful over time.
