**E-book Export** is a project to create downloadable electronic publications from selected pages of The Sunil Abraham Project (TSAP) as part of the preparations for the [30th Death Anniversary Commemoration of A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel](/amaa/30/). The initial objective is to compile approximately 8-10 pages into an e-book using Pandoc, producing EPUB and PDF editions while preserving the original source pages.

## Purpose

The purpose of this initiative is to establish a repeatable process for converting selected website content into well-formatted e-books suitable for offline reading, distribution and long-term preservation. The exported publications should contain the substantive article content rather than the surrounding website interface.

## Scope

The initial publication will include approximately 8-10 selected pages relating to A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel. The pages will be arranged in a defined reading order. Where necessary, individual sections can be included or excluded without modifying the original Markdown files.

The export process will exclude website headers, footers, navigation menus, breadcrumbs, existing article contents lists, category labels and other website-specific elements.

## Workflow

1. **Select the source pages:** Identify the articles to be included and specify their reading order.
2. **Extract the content:** Read the original Markdown files, remove YAML front matter and exclude website-specific markup while preserving substantive text.
3. **Apply section-selection rules:** Include or exclude specific sections where required.
4. **Assemble the manuscript:** Combine the selected content into a single Markdown manuscript, preserving headings, paragraphs, quotations, lists, tables, citations, links and relevant images.
5. **Prepare publication metadata:** Store the publication title, author or editor details, language and other metadata separately.
6. **Generate the table of contents:** Use Pandoc to generate a new book-level table of contents from the selected headings.
7. **Export the formats:** Generate EPUB and PDF editions with appropriate typography, margins, heading styles and page breaks.
8. **Review the output:** Compare the exported content with the source articles and check links, images, reading order and layout.

## Content and Formatting

Each selected article will begin with its title, followed by the relevant article content. The process should preserve meaningful formatting, including emphasis, quotations, citations, footnotes where present, tables, hyperlinks and images with their captions.

The website's existing contents lists will not be reproduced. Instead, a new table of contents will be generated for the assembled publication. Website navigation and other interface elements will not be included.

## Technical Implementation

The original Markdown files in the TSAP repository will remain the source of truth. A separate manifest will specify the selected pages and their order, with additional configuration for section-level inclusion or exclusion where necessary.

A build script will process the source files, extract the selected content, assemble the manuscript and invoke Pandoc to generate the output files. Separate metadata and styling files will control publication information and formatting.

The initial implementation will be tested locally on Ubuntu. GitHub Actions automation may be introduced after the extraction and export process has been tested and verified. The website will continue to be served through GitHub Pages; Pandoc will run as a separate part of the publication workflow.

## Output Formats

- **EPUB:** A reflowable format suitable for e-readers, reading applications and mobile devices.
- **PDF:** A fixed-layout format suitable for printing and reading on larger screens.

Both formats should be reviewed for accessibility, including logical heading levels, readable typography, meaningful link text and appropriate alternative text for images.

## Initial Milestone

The first milestone is to produce and review an EPUB and a PDF from a confirmed selection of 8-10 pages. The extraction rules must be verified against the original articles before the process is extended to additional publications.
