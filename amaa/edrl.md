Essays on Dalits, Religion and Liberation
</p>

***Essays on Dalits, Religion and Liberation*** (2006) is a seminal collection of scholarly articles by the Indian theologian and sociologist Reverend [Athanasius Mathen Abraham Ayrookuzhiel](https://sunilabraham.in/amaa/) (A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel) (1933–1996). The volume gathers his most significant writings, which critically explore the intersection of religion, culture, caste, and social justice in the context of the Dalit liberation struggle in India. The book is considered a foundational text for the development of Dalit theology and contextual Christian thought.

As noted in K. C. Abraham's foreword, Ayrookuzhiel's work stands out for its originality, depth, and rootedness in the social context of India's Dalits. Abraham describes the essays as "a continuation of his lifelong project to make theology an instrument of human liberation."

## Summary

The collection provides a framework for understanding the role of religion as both a system of domination and a source of resistance for India's marginalised communities. Across these essays, Ayrookuzhiel weaves together theology, anthropology, and social critique to reveal how the cultural world of Dalits contains both wounds and wisdom.

### Religious Colonisation and Deconstruction

A central theme in the collection is the idea of the "Hindu colonisation of Dalits." Ayrookuzhiel argues that the socio-economic subjugation of Dalits was reinforced by a religious process that appropriated their gods, myths, and rituals into a Brahmanical order. This “religious colonisation” deprived Dalits of their independent identity, transforming their faith into what he calls *opus alienum* — another’s work.  

His analysis calls for a radical deconstruction of this inherited religious identity. He insists that theology must expose how religion has been used to legitimise caste oppression and reclaim the suppressed narratives of the oppressed.

### Reconstruction of Authentic Dalit Culture

In contrast to deconstruction, Ayrookuzhiel also develops a constructive method — the reconstruction of authentic Dalit history and culture. Drawing on fieldwork, oral traditions, and performance studies, he identifies fragments of Dalit self-expression that have survived centuries of suppression. By interpreting these cultural acts, he recovers the creative agency of Dalit communities and their enduring search for dignity.  

This reconstruction is not a nostalgic exercise but a political and theological act. It aims to affirm Dalit cultural sovereignty and re-establish their sense of belonging within the broader religious landscape of India.

### Subversive Language of Theology

Another significant insight of the book is Ayrookuzhiel’s recognition of the subversive language of theology — the non-institutional, cultural forms through which the oppressed articulate faith. Rather than academic discourse, this theology speaks through story, song, humour, and satire.  

A striking example is his analysis of the folk ritual *Pottan Theyyam* from Kerala. The figure of Pottan, a divine protester, challenges caste hierarchies and mocks oppressive images of divinity. Ayrookuzhiel interprets this ritual as a theological drama in which the divine takes the side of the oppressed. Such acts, he argues, reveal that true theology happens not in books but in people’s struggles for justice.

## Publication History

The book was posthumously published in 2006 by the Asian Trading Corporation, Bangalore, for the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society (CISRS). Its release marked the tenth anniversary of Ayrookuzhiel's death on 29 November 1996 and coincided with the Golden Jubilee of CISRS, serving as both a memorial tribute and a reaffirmation of the institute's long-standing commitment to liberation-oriented theology.  

Many of the essays in this collection were first published in *Religion and Society*, the in-house journal of CISRS, while others originated as research papers or lectures presented at seminars on religion and social change. Bringing them together in a single volume allowed scholars and students to trace the evolution of Ayrookuzhiel's thought — from his early reflections on Indian religiosity to his mature formulations of Dalit theology and cultural resistance.  

The volume includes a foreword by Dr. Godwin Shiri and an introduction by theologian K. C. Abraham, both of whom had worked closely with Ayrookuzhiel at CISRS. It was published with the ISBN 8170863996.

## Critical Reception

Scholars and theologians have described *Essays on Dalits, Religion and Liberation* as a landmark in Indian theological thought. The collection bridges academic research and lived experience, combining sociological rigour with theological imagination.  

It remains a key reference in courses on Dalit theology, contextual theology, and sociology of religion. Its influence extends beyond Christian theology to Dalit cultural studies and postcolonial discourse. The foreword by K. C. Abraham notes that Ayrookuzhiel’s insights continue to challenge both the church and academia to ground their faith and research in solidarity with the oppressed.
