## Early Life and Education

Athanasius Mathen Abraham Ayrookuzhiel was born in in 1933 in Chengannur, a small town in the Alappuzha district of Kerala, India, into a family rooted in the Christian traditions of the region. He spent his childhood in Puthenkavu, a village known for its church heritage, and completed his early schooling in Katanam and Bharanikavu. His formative years were marked by an interest in moral questions, faith, and the social realities of rural Kerala.

Feeling a strong sense of vocation, he joined a seminary in Thiruvananthapuram, where he began his spiritual training as a novice of the Order of Ordine Imitationis Christi. His theological curiosity and dedication to disciplined study shaped his intellectual life. During these years, he became deeply influenced by the ideas of social responsibility and equality, themes that would later appear throughout his writings.

After completing his seminary formation, he pursued higher studies in Philosophy and Theology at the Pontificium Athenaeum Pooneuse in Pune, Maharashtra where he was ordained as a priest in 1963. His quest for knowledge led him to continue advanced studies in Rome and the United Kingdom, where he broadened his understanding of theology and social thought in a global context.

## Ministry and International Engagement

Rev. Ayrookuzhiel's early ministry was shaped by his exposure to both Catholic and Anglican traditions. After completing his studies abroad, he joined the Anglican Church and began his pastoral career at [St. Paul High Anglican Church](https://spauls.co.uk/) in Wokingham, Berkshire, United Kingdom. He served there as a curate from 1970 to 1973, ministering to diverse congregations and engaging with ecumenical networks.

His time in the UK coincided with important changes in global Christianity, particularly the rise of liberation theology and postcolonial discussions on faith and power. These developments left a lasting impression on his understanding of the church’s role in society.

During this period, he married Ponnamma Thekedath, marking a new phase in his personal and professional life. Together, they returned to India in 1973, committed to engaging with theology and social transformation in the Indian context.

## Work with CISRS

Upon his return to India, Rev. Ayrookuzhiel joined the [Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society](https://cisrs.in/) (CISRS), an influential ecumenical research body that brought together theologians, social scientists, and activists. Under the leadership of [Dr. M. M. Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._M._Thomas), one of India's most respected Christian thinkers, CISRS became a space for critical engagement with questions of development, caste, and justice.

Ayrookuzhiel quickly emerged as a thoughtful voice within this community. His combination of pastoral experience, academic training, and social concern made him an ideal fit for the institute’s work. Over the years, he rose to the position of Associate Director, guiding research initiatives, mentoring young theologians, and contributing to numerous seminars and conferences across India and abroad.

At CISRS, he explored how theology could engage with the lived experiences of Dalit and marginalised communities. He emphasised that Christian faith must not remain confined to doctrine or ritual, but must confront social inequalities and promote human dignity. His approach reflected a deep commitment to contextual theology — the idea that faith must speak to the realities of the local culture and historical moment.

Joining CISRS in 1974, Ayrookuzhiel brought with him years of rigorous theological training from Rome and Oxford. Within the institute, he shifted the study of religion towards viewing faith and culture through the eyes of the oppressed — particularly the Dalits. His work contributed to transforming CISRS’s research orientation from abstract theology to an engaged and socially grounded analysis of religion.

Through a series of field studies and theoretical reflections, he examined how religious traditions, cultural practices, and social hierarchies shaped the lived realities of marginalised communities. His approach introduced new analytical tools for understanding religion and culture as sites of both domination and resistance. These insights became foundational to the development of Dalit theology within Indian Christian thought.

During the 1970s, colleagues at CISRS, including K. C. Abraham, recalled that when Ayrookuzhiel joined the institute, little was known about him apart from his Oxford background and his invitation from M. M. Thomas. He soon proved to be a scholar with a difference. Rather than pursuing abstract doctrinal debate, he turned theology toward the social realities of India. For him, the Dalit struggle was the decisive test of a religion's relevance.

Ayrookuzhiel’s long-term project combined two movements — deconstruction and reconstruction. First, he questioned the assumption that Dalits were naturally part of Hinduism. He described how dominant castes had absorbed Dalit symbols, suppressing their independent identity and faith traditions. He called this process a form of religious colonisation and argued that liberation would come only when Dalits reclaimed their own cultural and religious expressions. The second movement involved reconstructing this heritage through myths, songs, and festivals that preserved traces of Dalit self-understanding. His studies of these oral traditions opened new ground for research at CISRS and beyond.

## Theological Perspective

Rev. Ayrookuzhiel's writings often bridged theology, sociology, and political thought. He questioned inherited hierarchies within both religion and society, arguing that spiritual liberation must be accompanied by social emancipation.

His theological outlook combined a respect for Indian religiosity with a critical awareness of caste structures and economic disparities. He sought to interpret Christian theology through the lens of the oppressed, and to reimagine religious identity in a pluralistic and hierarchical society.

Influenced by thinkers such as [M. M. Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._M._Thomas) and [B. R. Ambedkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar), Ayrookuzhiel's work contributed to what came to be known as Dalit Theology — a movement that centred the voices of the marginalised in theological reflection. For him, faith was inseparable from justice, and theology was an active force in transforming both individual and collective life.

His reflections combined deep empathy with analytical rigour. Ayrookuzhiel saw theology as a lived discipline, rooted in people’s struggles rather than confined to institutions. He believed that the task of theology was not only to interpret society but to participate in its transformation. His writings offered a methodology that linked cultural analysis with social justice — a vision that continues to shape theological and sociological discourse in India.

A distinctive feature of Ayrookuzhiel's later writings was his attention to what he called the subversive language of theology. He recognised that marginalised communities express faith not through systematic ideas but through story, humour, and protest. His analysis of the folk ritual of *Pottan Theyyam* in Kerala illustrated this approach. The image of Pottan, a counter-cultural divine figure, embodied resistance to caste oppression and questioned established images of divinity. For Ayrookuzhiel, such songs and performances were not mere folklore; they were theological acts that exposed false hierarchies and affirmed the dignity of the oppressed.

## Personal Life

During his years in the United Kingdom, Rev. A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel married Ponnamma Thekedath. The marriage took place while he was serving as a curate at St. Paul High Anglican Church, Wokingham, Berkshire, between 1970 and 1973.  

The couple later settled in Bangalore, where Ayrookuzhiel continued his research and teaching work with the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society (CISRS). They had three sons — [Sunil Abraham](https://sunilabraham.in/sunil/), Matthew Abraham, and Jacob Abraham. Sunil, the eldest, was born on 17 June 1973. The family home became a quiet centre of study and conversation, reflecting Ayrookuzhiel’s lifelong commitment to ideas and community.  

Although deeply engaged in academic and ecclesial life, he maintained close family bonds, often referring in his letters to the balance between scholarship and family life as part of his vocation.
