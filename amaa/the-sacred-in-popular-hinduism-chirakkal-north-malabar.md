***The Sacred in Popular Hinduism: An Empirical Study in Chirakkal, North Malabar*** is a sociological and theological study by A. M. Abraham Ayrookuzhiel. First published in 1983 by the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society (CISRS), Bangalore, in association with the Christian Literature Society (CLS), the book marks an early attempt to examine Hinduism as it is lived and spoken about by ordinary people in the Chirakkal region of Kerala, rather than through classical texts or formal philosophical traditions. 

A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel, whose work spans Dalit studies and the sociology of religion, approached the subject through direct observation and field-based research. His study records how religious belief and practice operate in the everyday lives of ordinary people, drawing a clear contrast between what he terms “popular” Hinduism and the more formal, Sanskritic versions often presented as the authorised tradition.

## Summary

The study is set in Chirakkal, a historic area of North Malabar, Kerala, India. This region has its own cultural character and is especially noted for Teyyam (also spelled Theyyam), the ritual performance tradition in which practitioners invoke and embody local deities.

Rather than examining major temple centres or focusing on pan-Indian gods, the book turns to a religious landscape shaped by local shrines (kavus), ancestral veneration, and non-Brahminical ritual practices. Religious life in this setting includes the worship of figures such as Bhagavati (the Mother Goddess), Gulikan, Pottan, and various deified ancestors and local heroes, alongside familiar Hindu deities like Shiva and Vishnu.

## Chapters
The book is divided into eight chapters, covering different aspects of the sacred as understood and practised in Chirakkal.

- II. The Sacred as Expressed in People's God-Talk
- III. The Sacred as Conceived Through (Other) Symbols of Worship  
- IV. The Conception of the Sacred in Stories
- V. The Conception of the Sacred in Shrines, Rituals and Festivals
- VI. The Sacred in the Everyday Use of the Symbol *Karma*
- VII. Durbādhakal — Evil Powers
- VIII. Reflections
