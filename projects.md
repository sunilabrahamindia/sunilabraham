# Projects

The **Sunil Abraham Project** documents, studies, and archives a range of open research and creative work.  
Documentation is at the core of this effort — it preserves knowledge, captures the process behind ideas, and makes insights accessible to others.  
By maintaining structured, open documentation, projects remain transparent, collaborative, and easy to build upon.
