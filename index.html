      <p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the knowledge sharing and documentation portal of <strong>Sunil Abraham</strong>. This open source project collects and publishes notes, essays, and documentation in a clean, accessible format.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>This project serves as a living documentation space for research, writing, and reflection.<br />
It is built to create, organise, and publish documentation in a structured yet flexible manner,<br />
enabling continuous learning and open exchange of ideas.</p>

<p>It aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create and maintain documentation — capture insights, notes, essays, and drafts across themes and disciplines.</li>
  <li>Encourage knowledge sharing — make ideas accessible, referenceable, and adaptable for wider audiences.</li>
  <li>Support learning and reflection — develop patterns of learning, synthesis, and critical thought through open writing.</li>
  <li>Enable collaboration and contribution — allow others to engage with, remix, and build upon existing materials.</li>
  <li>Host brainstorming and ideation — serve as a space for developing and refining emerging ideas and projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>This documentation evolves over time, not as a static archive, but as a continuous process of thinking, writing, and sharing.</p>

<p>Sunil Abraham (IAST: Sunīl Ābrahām; IPA: suːˈniːl ˈɑːbrəˌhɑːm) is an Indian internet researcher, public policy advocate, and social entrepreneur known for his pioneering work at the intersection of technology, society, and governance.</p>

<p>Sunil is the founder and former executive director of the <a href="https://cis-india.org/">Centre for Internet and Society</a> (CIS), a Bangalore-based non-profit research organisation established in 2008 to explore the relationship between the internet and social change. CIS brings together scholars, technologists, and activists to study issues such as internet governance, privacy, accessibility, and freedom of expression.</p>

<p>In 1998, he founded Mahiti Infotech, a social enterprise designed to make technology affordable and effective for the voluntary sector through Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Under his leadership, Mahiti has supported hundreds of civil society organisations with digital tools, training, and open technology solutions.</p>

<p>Sunil was elected an Ashoka Fellow in 1999 for exploring the democratic potential of the internet and later received the Sarai FLOSS Fellowship in 2003. Between 2004 and 2007, he managed the International Open Source Network (IOSN), a UNDP initiative promoting FOSS across the Asia-Pacific, and later coordinated ENRAP, linking rural development projects through ICT.</p>

<p>His contributions extend to advising governments, UN agencies, and advocacy groups on open standards, internet policy, and digital rights. A frequent lecturer and writer, Sunil’s work highlights issues of openness, equity, and accountability in technology. His lifelong mission remains to ensure that innovation strengthens democracy and social inclusion rather than deepening inequality.</p>
