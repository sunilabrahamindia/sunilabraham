## About

This project serves as a living documentation space for research, writing, and reflection.  
This is built to create, organise, and publish documentation in a structured yet flexible manner, enabling continuous learning and open exchange of ideas.

It aims to:

- Create and maintain documentation — capture insights, notes, essays, and drafts across themes and disciplines.  
- Encourage knowledge sharing — make ideas accessible, referenceable, and adaptable for wider audiences.  
- Support learning and reflection — develop patterns of learning, synthesis, and critical thought through open writing.  
- Enable collaboration and contribution — allow others to engage with, remix, and build upon existing materials.  
- Host brainstorming and ideation — serve as a space for developing and refining emerging ideas and projects.  

This documentation evolves over time, not as a static archive, but as a continuous process of thinking, writing, and sharing.

## Featured article
**Rev. Athanasius Mathen Abraham Ayrookuzhiel (1933–1996)** was an Indian theologian, priest, and scholar whose work bridged faith, culture, and social justice. Educated in philosophy and theology in Pune, Rome, and Oxford, he combined pastoral life with a deep interest in the moral and social struggles of ordinary people. His ministry in the Church of England and later in India reflected a conviction that religion must respond to the realities of oppression and inequality.

After returning to India, he joined the [Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society](https://cisrs.in/) in Bangalore, where he became Associate Director. Working closely with theologian M. M. Thomas, he explored how Christian thought could engage with caste and class through the lived experiences of Dalit communities. His research on folk religion, ritual, and oral traditions offered new ways of understanding theology as a form of cultural expression and resistance.

Among his major works are *The Sacred in Popular Hinduism*, *Swami Anand Thirth: Untouchability, Gandhian Solution on Trial*, and the posthumous *Essays on Dalits, Religion, and Liberation*. Until his death in 1996, Ayrookuzhiel remained dedicated to a theology rooted in the struggles of the marginalised—a vision that continues to shape Indian Christian and social thought.

Sunil Abraham (IAST: Sunīl Ābrahām; IPA: suːˈniːl ˈɑːbrəˌhɑːm) is an Indian internet researcher, public policy advocate, and social entrepreneur known for his pioneering work at the intersection of technology, society, and governance.  

Sunil is a co-founder and former executive director of the [Centre for Internet and Society](https://cis-india.org/) (CIS), a Bangalore-based non-profit research organisation established in 2008 to explore the relationship between the internet and social change. CIS brings together scholars, technologists, and activists to study issues such as internet governance, privacy, accessibility, and freedom of expression.  

In 1998, he founded [Mahiti Infotech](https://mahiti.org/), a social enterprise designed to make technology affordable and effective for the voluntary sector through Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Under his leadership, Mahiti has supported hundreds of civil society organisations with digital tools, training, and open technology solutions.  

His contributions extend to advising governments, UN agencies, and advocacy groups on open standards, internet policy, and digital rights. A frequent lecturer and writer, Sunil's work highlights issues of openness, equity, and accountability in technology. His lifelong mission remains to ensure that innovation strengthens democracy and social inclusion rather than deepening inequality.
