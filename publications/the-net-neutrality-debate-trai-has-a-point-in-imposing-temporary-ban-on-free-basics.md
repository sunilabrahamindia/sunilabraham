**The net neutrality debate: Trai has a point in imposing temporary ban on Free Basics** is an opinion column by Sunil Abraham, published in *Firstpost* on 25 December 2015.  
The article argues that while evidence-based regulation is important, principle-based policymaking — grounded in non-discrimination, transparency, and fairness — is essential in ensuring equitable access and innovation on the Internet.

  <p>The argument against net neutrality in India is simple. Regulation cannot be based on dogma – evidence of harm must be provided before you can advocate for rules for ISPs and telecom operators. But net neutrality, regardless of your preferred definition, is a very complex regulatory question and there is no global or even national consensus on what counts as relevant evidence. To demonstrate the chain of causality between network neutrality violations and potential harms requires expertise across multiple fields – economics, competition law, telecom policy, spectrum allocation, communications engineering and traffic management. Even with a large research budget and a multidisciplinary team, it would be impossible to predict with confidence what the impact of a particular regulatory option will be on the digital divide or innovation. Therefore, advocates of forbearance argue that the Indian telecom regulator — TRAI — should not regulate unprecedented technical and business model innovations like Facebook’s Free Basics since we don’t yet understand them.</p>

  <p>Till recently, I agreed with this empirical line of argument. But increasingly, I am less convinced that scientific evidence should be the only basis for regulation. Perhaps there is a small but necessary role for principles or ideology. Like the subtitle of Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s book, we must ask: “How to Live in a World We Don’t Understand.” Consider another domain — cyber security. Do we need to build a centralised database containing the passwords of all netizens and perform experiments to establish that it can be compromised? Of course not. A 100 percent centralised system has a single point of failure; therefore, from a security perspective, centralisation is almost always a bad idea. Decentralisation eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure, thereby improving resilience. The Internet itself is perhaps the most famous example. Thus, the principle of decentralisation in cyber security does not require repeated experimental confirmation across markets and technologies.</p>

  <p>To complicate matters, the most optimal solutions derived from economics and engineering may not be politically or socially acceptable. Professor Vishal Misra has offered a Shapley Value solution using cooperative game theory to determine how surplus should be divided between three types of ISPs — eyeball, transit, and content — through transparent paid transit arrangements. However, a migration to such a model may never happen because Internet companies will resist such transparency, especially as many now operate their own access networks like Google Fiber and Project Loon. Walter Brown of the South African Communications Forum, on the other hand, proposes that billing by minutes for calls and billing by message for SMS be prohibited, since on 4G networks voice and text are carried as data. This, he argues, would eliminate telco incentives to throttle or discriminate against VoIP traffic. But regulators prefer incremental change with minimal disruption, so such proposals rarely advance.</p>

  <p>Given these challenges, what principles should underpin India’s net neutrality policy? First, the obvious principle of non-discrimination — anyone with gatekeeping powers might abuse them, so we must prevent that possibility through regulation. Non-exclusivity follows from non-discrimination, and transparency is its precondition. Together, these form three core principles to work with, sufficient to keep regulation simple. Some experts have added fairness and proportionality as complementary principles. The appropriate way to settle such debates is through transparent, participatory policymaking — as India’s approach has been so far.</p>

  <p>How can we apply these principles to a specific case such as Facebook’s Free Basics? Through the office of the appropriate regulator. As Chris Marsden argues, net neutrality regulations should be positive and forward-looking — with more incentives and obligations than prohibitions. For instance, zero-rated walled gardens could be regulated by requiring that promoters such as Facebook also provide 50 MB of data per day to all users, and by mandating that other operators offering similar services receive equal treatment. Alternatively, Free Basics users could be granted access to the entire Internet every other hour. These measures would ensure competition and innovation while minimising harm.</p>

  <p>To be clear, advocating principle-based regulation does not mean rejecting the role of evidence and research. As implementation proceeds, future regulation or forbearance must be informed by data. However, the absence of evidence of harm cannot justify regulatory inaction. India is the last major market where a walled garden could outgrow the open Internet — and Facebook is making its strongest attempt. Fortunately, TRAI has acted wisely by imposing a temporary prohibition until the regulatory framework is finalised. As seen in the US, stable regulation may take a decade, but we cannot allow Facebook to shape the market in the meantime.</p>

## Context and Background

This article was written at the height of India’s net neutrality debate, following TRAI’s decision to suspend Facebook’s Free Basics programme.  
Sunil Abraham argues for principle-based regulation rooted in fairness, non-discrimination, and transparency — highlighting that temporary restrictions are justified when evidence alone cannot protect the public interest.
