  <p>All nine pillars of Digital India directly correlate with policy research conducted at the Centre for Internet and Society, where I have worked for the last seven years. This allows our research outputs to speak directly to the priorities of the government when it comes to digital transformation.</p>

  <p><strong>Broadband Highways and Universal Access to Mobile Connectivity:</strong> Both require spectrum policy and governance fixes. Shyam Ponappa, a distinguished fellow at our Centre, calls for leveraging shared spectrum and backhaul infrastructure. Plurality in spectrum management — for example, promoting unlicensed spectrum — can accelerate connectivity for communities and local governments. State-owned telcos should exit the last mile and focus on open access backhaul through Bharat Broadband Limited. Network neutrality regulations are also vital to mitigate free speech, diversity, and competition harms as ISPs and TSPs experiment with new business models like zero-rating.</p>

  <p><strong>Public Internet Access Programme:</strong> Continued investment in Common Service Centres (CSCs) needs a citizen’s audit to evaluate effectiveness. Reinventing post offices is welcome, but public libraries also need urgent revitalisation. CSCs, post offices, and libraries should all use long-range Wi-Fi and enable Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) access. Meanwhile, Indic-language content should be locally cached, and State Public Library Acts amended to permit digital borrowing. Flat-fee licensing regimes and support for commons-based peer production — such as Wikipedia and Wikisource — will expand access to knowledge.</p>

  <p><strong>e-Governance: Reforming Government through Technology:</strong> Under R. S. Sharma, the Department of Electronics and IT accelerated adoption of free software, open standards, and accessibility. The government should continue resisting proprietary software lobbies. Universal adoption of electronic signatures must be prioritised to ensure audit trails for official communications. Data protection principles like minimisation through form simplification deserve praise, but mandatory Aadhaar use for DigiLocker and eSign violates Supreme Court orders.</p>

  <p><strong>e-Kranti — Electronic Delivery of Services:</strong> The 41 mission-mode projects under Digital India risk failure due to top-down design. Instead, funds should incentivise public–private partnerships that promote adoption. Dependency on the National Informatics Centre (NIC) must be reduced to let SMEs build applications. The proposed Electronic Services Delivery Bill should require all ministries to publish service level agreements (SLAs) and specify penalties for non-compliance, ensuring accountability similar to the Right to Information Act.</p>

  <p><strong>Information for All:</strong> The open data and RTI communities are dissatisfied with the slow implementation of the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP). Most datasets released are of low value and lack commercial utility. High-value datasets must be prioritised by amending the proactive disclosure provisions of the RTI Act.</p>

  <p><strong>Electronics Manufacturing:</strong> With multiple mobile patent lawsuits ongoing, India should replicate its pharmaceutical success by creating a patent pool for mobile technologies. My colleague Rohini Lakshané and Professor Jorge Contreras estimate that such a mechanism could generate royalties of around USD 1 billion annually while providing certainty to manufacturers and reducing litigation.</p>

  <p><strong>IT for Jobs:</strong> Government-led, centralised training schemes are inefficient. Instead, India should reform curricula and restructure education around free and open source software (FOSS). Students should learn by reading and contributing to open code — becoming creators rather than mere operators. Project-based learning linked to real open-source initiatives would strengthen skills and innovation capacity. Funds should incentivise such contributions through micro-grants, prizes, and academic recognition.</p>

  <p><strong>Early Harvest Programmes:</strong> Some ideas, such as secure government email, are valuable and could reduce foreign surveillance risks. However, others — like biometric attendance systems — are superficial and do not improve governance outcomes. Policy focus should remain on transparency, security, and decentralisation rather than bureaucratic control.</p>
