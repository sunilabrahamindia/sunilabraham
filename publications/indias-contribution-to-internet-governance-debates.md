## Abstract

The study explores India’s approach to Internet governance through a review of major events and policy positions from 2010 to 2018. It analyses how India has balanced its domestic priorities of security, sovereignty and economic development with the global principles of openness and collaboration. The paper highlights India’s participation at venues such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and NETmundial, evaluating how these engagements reflect an ongoing evolution in policy thinking. 


## Context

The discourse on Internet governance has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, driven by issues such as data protection, cyber security, and global digital trade. For India, a country with one of the world’s largest online populations, participation in these debates is both a diplomatic and developmental priority. The paper situates India’s policy trajectory within the wider global movement towards inclusive governance models and multistakeholderism. It notes that India’s initial cautious engagement gradually gave way to a more proactive stance as the Internet became central to economic and political life.

## Key Themes

- **Shifting Policy Stance:** India’s early positions were guided by concerns of sovereignty and state control, but these later expanded to include citizen rights, openness and innovation.  
- **Multistakeholder Engagement:** The country’s increasing presence in IGF and WSIS processes demonstrates an ongoing acceptance of participatory governance.  
- **Regional Leadership:** India’s advocacy for developing country perspectives has influenced global policy conversations, especially on access and digital equity.  
- **Institutional Gaps:** Despite progress, the authors identify limited coordination across ministries and the absence of a cohesive national Internet governance framework.  
- **Balancing Competing Interests:** The research underscores India’s effort to navigate tensions between security imperatives, economic growth, and global collaboration.
