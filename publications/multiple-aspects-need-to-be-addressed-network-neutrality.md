<div class="highlighted-text" id="fulltext">
  <p>As the clamour for net neutrality grows louder, it is important to recognise that there are multiple aspects to the issue that need to be addressed. The principles of network neutrality — that internet service providers (ISPs) and telecom operators must treat all data on the internet equally — sound simple in theory but become complicated in practice when economics, technology and public interest collide.</p>

  <p>Telecom operators have argued that they invest heavily in infrastructure but receive little return from over-the-top (OTT) service providers like WhatsApp, Skype and YouTube, who make profits using telecom networks. They claim that allowing differential pricing or prioritised access would help recover costs and support innovation. However, such practices can harm smaller startups and users by creating a “walled garden” internet where only those who can afford to pay telecom operators receive fair visibility.</p>

  <p>Consumers, activists and digital rights groups have voiced strong opposition to such differential treatment, arguing that it undermines the open architecture of the internet — one of the key factors behind its success as a platform for innovation and free expression. In India, the public response to attempts at zero-rating plans and selective access has been overwhelming, with thousands participating in online campaigns calling for strong net neutrality rules.</p>

  <p>Yet the issue cannot be viewed through a single lens. From a regulatory perspective, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) must balance competing interests — protecting consumer rights, ensuring fair competition and maintaining incentives for infrastructure investment. Additionally, network neutrality must be distinguished from related but separate policy concerns such as online content regulation, spectrum allocation, and universal access obligations.</p>

  <p>It is also important to differentiate between types of zero-rating. Some schemes, such as Facebook's Free Basics (then Internet.org), claim to provide free access to essential services but, in practice, privilege specific platforms, shaping what new internet users can see or do online. Others — such as data subsidies that allow users to access any content of their choice — are more consistent with the principles of net neutrality and consumer freedom.</p>

  <p>India's internet policy must also take into account the needs of users who remain offline. With fewer than 20% of the population having access to broadband in 2015, digital inclusion is not merely a moral concern but an economic imperative. As data costs drop and smartphone penetration rises, the challenge for policymakers is to protect openness while enabling connectivity for the unconnected.</p>

  <p>The debate around net neutrality should not be reduced to slogans or binary choices between freedom and control. Instead, it requires a nuanced understanding of how policy, technology and markets intersect. The goal should be to ensure that every Indian — not just the affluent or urban elite — can access an open, affordable and innovation-friendly internet that serves the public interest.</p>
