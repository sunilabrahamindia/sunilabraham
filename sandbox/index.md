## Biography
Rev. A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel (1933–1996) was an Indian theologian who linked faith with the social realities of marginalised communities. Born in Kerala and trained in seminaries in India and Europe, he developed an interest in how belief, justice, and everyday life come together. His years in the United Kingdom, where he served as a curate in Wokingham and married Ponnamma Thekedath, broadened his understanding of the church’s role in a changing world. The couple returned to India in 1973, where he began shaping a theology rooted in local experience.

At the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society (CISRS) in Bangalore, Ayrookuzhiel helped shift attention towards the struggles of Dalits and other oppressed groups. He argued that theology should grow from people’s lived realities rather than abstract debate. His research drew on field studies and cultural traditions, showing how stories, songs, and rituals expressed both suffering and resistance. These insights contributed to the early formation of Dalit Theology in India.

Across books, essays, and edited volumes, he explored caste, culture, and religion with clarity and empathy. Many writings were later collected in *Essays on Dalits, Religion and Liberation* (2006). At the time of his death in 1996, he was working on a major study of Dalit religious identity. His work continues to influence discussions on justice, culture, and the role of faith in public life.

## Major works
*Essays on Dalits, Religion and Liberation* (2006) brings together Rev. A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel’s most important writings on caste, culture, and the role of religion in shaping social life. The essays show how he approached theology from the viewpoint of Dalit experience rather than formal doctrine. Drawing on fieldwork, oral traditions, and community practices, he examined how rituals, stories, and symbols carried both memories of oppression and sources of strength. A recurring theme in the book is his idea of religious colonisation, where dominant groups absorbed Dalit traditions into a system that denied their independent identity. At the same time, he highlighted the creative ways Dalit communities preserved their own cultural expressions. The collection traces his effort to make theology a tool for dignity and liberation. Published a decade after his death, the volume remains a key resource for understanding Indian contextual and Dalit theology.
