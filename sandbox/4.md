  <h1>Timeline of Aadhaar</h1>
  <p><strong>Aadhaar</strong> is a 12-digit unique identity number that can be obtained voluntarily by citizens of India and resident foreign nationals who have spent over 182 days in twelve months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment, based on their biometric and demographic data. The data is collected by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), a statutory authority established in January 2009 by the Government of India. Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric ID system.</p>
  <p>The project has been linked to public subsidy schemes, unemployment benefits, and financial services. While it has been praised for plugging leaks in welfare delivery, it has also faced significant criticism and legal challenges regarding privacy, data security, and exclusion. In 2018, the Supreme Court of India upheld the validity of the Aadhaar system but struck down certain provisions, including the mandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile numbers.</p>

      <p>The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, categorically rejects the National Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010. The committee calls the draft legislation "directionless" and lacking clarity on what the government would achieve through the UID scheme. It expresses apprehension that the data collected for Aadhaar could end up in the hands of private players and be misused, as private organizations and individuals are involved in the implementation process. The committee urges the government to "reconsider and review the UID scheme as also the proposals contained in the Bill in all its ramifications and bring forth a fresh legislation before Parliament." The report is presented to Parliament on 11 December 2011.</p>

      <p>The Supreme Court delivers its landmark judgment on the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act in a 4:1 majority decision. The majority judgment, written by Justice AK Sikri in concurrence with Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice AM Khanwilkar, upholds the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act for welfare schemes, finding it satisfies the proportionality test and serves a legitimate state interest. However, the court strikes down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act, which allowed private entities (such as banks, telecom companies, and schools) to demand Aadhaar for authentication. The court sets aside linking Aadhaar to bank accounts and mobile phone numbers, ruling these are not mandatory. While it upholds seeding of PAN with Aadhaar, it rules Aadhaar is not mandatory for school admissions, CBSE, UGC, and NEET examinations. Justice DY Chandrachud writes a dissenting opinion, arguing that the entire Aadhaar programme since 2009 suffers from constitutional infirmities and violations of fundamental rights, and that Parliament's passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill amounted to "a fraud on the Constitution." The court also strikes down the National Security Exception under the Aadhaar Act, restricting government access to individual Aadhaar data.</p>

      <p>Parliament passes the Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019, allowing voluntary use of Aadhaar for Know Your Customer (KYC) purposes by banks, telecom companies, and other entities. The amendment effectively reinstates some private sector use of Aadhaar through a legislative route, circumventing the Supreme Court's striking down of Section 57. Critics argue this undermines the 2018 Supreme Court judgment.</p>

      <p>Parliament passes the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which allows for the linking of Voter ID (EPIC - Electoral Photo Identity Card) with Aadhaar on a voluntary basis. The opposition criticizes the bill for potentially disenfranchising voters, enabling voter profiling, and violating the 2018 Supreme Court judgment that limited Aadhaar's scope. Civil liberties groups raise concerns about creating a surveillance apparatus through the linking of electoral and biometric databases.</p>

The proposed design would display only a photograph and a QR code on the card, removing visible personal details such as name, address, and date of birth to minimize identity theft risks. The proposal is expected to be reviewed in December 2025, with implementation planned for subsequent months.</p>
