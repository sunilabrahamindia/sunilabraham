## Lived experience of AI Impact Summit attendees with electric and electronic technologies

Unlike, the previous Summits which were more exclusive, the Delhi edition of the Bletchley Park process was the most open to all stakeholders of the AI era. The gratis and free entry provided to all at India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi (16–20 February 2026) caused hotel rates in Delhi-NCR to surge sharply, with luxury suites reaching ₹30 lakh and standard five-star rooms ₹4–5 lakh per night. While this provides us with an understanding of the experience of the elite participants of the Summit from government, global corporations and NGOs, it does not provide the participants of the Summit with a true understanding of the diversity of  experiences of all sum of all participants. This article uses anecdotal and singular data from three locations in New Delhi to provide a little more colour to the picture that we have of the type of participants that were at the Summit and the impact of the diffusion of electric and electronic technologies in their lives. 


The summit reportedly drew:
- Over 35,000 registrations
- Delegations from more than 100 countries
- 15–20 heads of government
- Over 40 CEOs
