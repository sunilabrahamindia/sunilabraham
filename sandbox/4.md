**Aadhaar** is a 12-digit unique identity number that can be obtained voluntarily by citizens of India and resident foreign nationals who have spent over 182 days in twelve months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment, based on their biometric and demographic data. The data is collected by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), a statutory authority established in January 2009 by the Government of India ([UIDAI Official](https://uidai.gov.in/en/about-uidai/unique-identification-authority-of-india.html)). Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric ID system.

The project has been linked to public subsidy schemes, unemployment benefits, and financial services. While it has been praised for plugging leaks in welfare delivery, it has also faced significant criticism and legal challenges regarding privacy, data security, and exclusion. In 2018, the Supreme Court of India upheld the validity of the Aadhaar system but struck down certain provisions, including the mandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile numbers ([Indian Express, 26 September 2018](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/)).

## 2009

### Establishment of UIDAI

**28 January 2009**: The Planning Commission of India issues a notification in the *Gazette of India* to establish the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) as an attached office under the Planning Commission ([UIDAI Official Notification](https://uidai.gov.in/en/legal-framework/notifications.html); [PIB, 15 January 2014](https://www.pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=102540)). The UIDAI is tasked with laying down plans and policies to implement the UID scheme, owning and operating the UID database, and maintaining it on an ongoing basis ([UIDAI](https://uidai.gov.in/en/about-uidai/unique-identification-authority-of-india.html)).

### Appointment of Nandan Nilekani

**25 June 2009**: Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys, is appointed by the UPA-II government as the first Chairman of UIDAI, with the rank equivalent to a Cabinet Minister ([Infosys Press Release, 25 June 2009](https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/documents/2009/nandan-chairperson-uidai.pdf)). Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh invites him to take charge of the unique identification project ([Infosys Press Release, 25 June 2009](https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/documents/2009/nandan-chairperson-uidai.pdf)). His resignation from Infosys becomes effective 9 July 2009 ([Infosys Press Release, 25 June 2009](https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/documents/2009/nandan-chairperson-uidai.pdf)).

## 2010

### First Aadhaar Number Issued

**29 September 2010**: The first Aadhaar number is issued to Ranjna Sadashiv Sonwane, a tribal woman from Tembhali village in the Nandurbar district of Maharashtra ([UIDAI Press Note](https://uidai.gov.in/images/pressrelease/pressnotefinal.doc); [PIB, 15 January 2014](https://www.pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=102540)). The national launch is attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who hands the Aadhaar letter to Ranjna ([UIDAI Press Note](https://uidai.gov.in/images/pressrelease/pressnotefinal.doc)). Her five-year-old son Hitesh receives the second Aadhaar number, marking his first proof of identity ([UIDAI Press Note](https://uidai.gov.in/images/pressrelease/pressnotefinal.doc)).

### Bill Introduced in Parliament

**3 December 2010**: The National Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010, is introduced in the Rajya Sabha by the UPA government to give statutory backing to the UIDAI ([PRS India](https://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-national-identification-authority-of-india-bill-2010-1196); [SFLC India](https://sflc.in/journey-aadhaar/)). The bill is subsequently referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance for examination ([Indian Express, 9 July 2014](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aadhaar-didnt-fit-the-bill/)).

## 2011

### Standing Committee Rejects Bill

**December 2011**: The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, categorically rejects the National Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010 ([The New Indian Express, 14 December 2011](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2011/Dec/14/panel-rejects-draft-of-aadhar-two-other-bills-320177.html); [India Today, 8 December 2011](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/uid-bill-aadhaar-scheme-nandan-nilekani-mha-148229-2011-12-08)). The committee calls the draft legislation "directionless" and lacking clarity on what the government would achieve through the UID scheme ([The New Indian Express, 14 December 2011](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2011/Dec/14/panel-rejects-draft-of-aadhar-two-other-bills-320177.html)). It expresses apprehension that the data collected for Aadhaar could end up in the hands of private players and be misused, as private organizations and individuals are involved in the implementation process ([The New Indian Express, 14 December 2011](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2011/Dec/14/panel-rejects-draft-of-aadhar-two-other-bills-320177.html)). The committee urges the government to "reconsider and review the UID scheme as also the proposals contained in the Bill in all its ramifications and bring forth a fresh legislation before Parliament" ([Indian Express, 9 July 2014](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aadhaar-didnt-fit-the-bill/)). The report is presented to Parliament on 11 December 2011 ([Indian Express, 9 July 2014](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aadhaar-didnt-fit-the-bill/)).

## 2012

### Direct Benefit Transfer Launched

**1 January 2013**: The government launches the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, aiming to transfer subsidies directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries using Aadhaar as the bridge to eliminate intermediaries and reduce corruption ([ClearTax](https://cleartax.in/s/direct-benefit-transfer)). This marks a significant policy shift toward digital welfare delivery.

### Privacy Challenge Filed

**November 2012**: Retired Justice K.S. Puttaswamy files a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court challenging the validity of Aadhaar on the grounds that it violates the fundamental right to privacy ([Economic Times, 26 September 2018](https://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/chronology-of-aadhaar-case/articleshow/65965443.cms)). This initiates a protracted legal battle over the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar project.

## 2013

### Supreme Court Interim Order

**23 September 2013**: In a significant interim order, the Supreme Court rules that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for accessing essential government services and subsidies ([The Hindu, 23 September 2013](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-says-aadhaar-not-mandatory-for-essential-services/article5160980.ece); [iPleaders, 7 June 2019](https://blog.ipleaders.in/aadhar-right-privacy/)). The court emphasizes the voluntary nature of the program and directs that no citizen should suffer for not having an Aadhaar card even when the government makes it mandatory for certain benefits ([iPleaders, 7 June 2019](https://blog.ipleaders.in/aadhar-right-privacy/)).

## 2014

### NDA Government Retains Aadhaar

**2014**: The newly elected NDA government, despite the BJP's earlier criticism of the project during the Standing Committee review, decides to retain the Aadhaar program and sets a target to enroll 100 crore (1 billion) residents. The government recognizes the potential of Aadhaar for reducing leakages in welfare schemes and improving service delivery.

## 2015

### Use Restricted to Select Schemes

**11 August 2015**: A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court restricts the use of Aadhaar to only the Public Distribution System (PDS), LPG (cooking gas), and kerosene distribution, while reiterating that the card remains voluntary ([The Hindu, 11 August 2015](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-restricts-aadhaar-use-to-pds-lpg-kerosene/article7524903.ece)). The court prohibits the government from making Aadhaar mandatory for any other services pending final adjudication.

## 2016

### Aadhaar Act Passed as Money Bill

**29 February 2016**: During the budget presentation, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announces that a bill will be introduced within a week to provide legislative support to Aadhaar ([SFLC India](https://sflc.in/how-parliament-debated-aadhaar-bill-2016/)).

**3 March 2016**: The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016, is introduced in the Lok Sabha by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as a Money Bill ([PRS India](https://prsindia.org/billtrack/the-aadhaar-targeted-delivery-of-financial-and-other-subsidies-benefits-and-services-bill-2016)). This classification sparks widespread constitutional debate as it prevents the Rajya Sabha (where the government lacked a majority) from rejecting it, allowing only recommendations ([SFLC India](https://sflc.in/how-parliament-debated-aadhaar-bill-2016/)).

**11 March 2016**: The Lok Sabha passes the Aadhaar Bill by a voice vote with a quorum of 73 out of 545 members ([SFLC India](https://sflc.in/how-parliament-debated-aadhaar-bill-2016/)). Opposition members raise concerns about potential mass surveillance and question why the bill was introduced as a Money Bill, arguing it doesn't fit the definition under Article 110 of the Constitution ([SFLC India](https://sflc.in/how-parliament-debated-aadhaar-bill-2016/)).

**15 March 2016**: The Secretary of the Rajya Sabha formally notifies the house that the bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha ([SFLC India](https://sflc.in/how-parliament-debated-aadhaar-bill-2016/)). During debates spanning two days, Naresh Agrawal of Samajwadi Party argues that the bill doesn't fit into the definition of a Money Bill ([SFLC India](https://sflc.in/how-parliament-debated-aadhaar-bill-2016/)).

**26 March 2016**: The Aadhaar Act receives Presidential assent and is notified in the *Gazette of India* ([Business Standard, 26 March 2016](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/president-gives-assent-to-aadhaar-act-116032600465_1.html)). The Act provides legal backing to UIDAI's operations and Aadhaar-based service delivery.

## 2017

### Aadhaar-PAN Linkage Mandated

**March 2017**: The government mandates linking Aadhaar with PAN (Permanent Account Number) cards for filing income tax returns, expanding the scope of Aadhaar beyond welfare schemes to tax compliance ([The Hindu, March 2017](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/aadhaar-mandatory-for-pan-it-returns/article17551062.ece)). This move faces criticism from privacy advocates who argue it exceeds the limited purpose outlined in the Aadhaar Act.

### Right to Privacy Declared Fundamental Right

**24 August 2017**: In a historic unanimous verdict, a nine-judge Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India* declares the Right to Privacy a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution ([The Hindu, 24 August 2017](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/right-to-privacy-is-a-fundamental-right-sc/article19551817.ece); [EFF, 10 October 2017](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/indias-supreme-court-upholds-right-privacy-fundamental-right-and-its-about-time)). The 547-page judgment signed by all nine judges overrules past observations that had questioned the existence of a fundamental right to privacy ([EFF, 10 October 2017](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/indias-supreme-court-upholds-right-privacy-fundamental-right-and-its-about-time)). This landmark judgment sets the stage for more rigorous scrutiny of the Aadhaar project's privacy implications and creates a constitutional framework for data protection ([EFF, 10 October 2017](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/08/indias-supreme-court-upholds-right-privacy-fundamental-right-and-its-about-time)).

## 2018

### Major Data Security Breach Exposed

**4 January 2018**: *The Tribune* publishes an investigative report revealing that access to the Aadhaar database is being sold on WhatsApp for ₹500, sparking a national debate on data security ([The Tribune, 4 January 2018](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/nation/rs-500-10-minutes-and-you-have-access-to-billion-aadhaar-details-523361); [Newslaundry, 3 January 2018](https://www.newslaundry.com/2018/01/04/tribune-aadhaar-details-whatsapp-uidai)). The investigative journalist obtains login credentials that provide unrestricted access to personal details of over one billion Aadhaar holders, including names, addresses, phone numbers, and photographs ([The Tribune, 4 January 2018](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/nation/rs-500-10-minutes-and-you-have-access-to-billion-aadhaar-details-523361)). For an additional ₹300, software to print Aadhaar cards is also made available ([The Tribune, 4 January 2018](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/nation/rs-500-10-minutes-and-you-have-access-to-billion-aadhaar-details-523361)). UIDAI officials in Chandigarh admit the breach appears to be a "major national security breach" ([The Tribune, 4 January 2018](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/nation/rs-500-10-minutes-and-you-have-access-to-billion-aadhaar-details-523361)). Investigations reveal that over one lakh village-level enterprise (VLE) operators may have gained illegal access to the database ([The Tribune, 4 January 2018](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/nation/rs-500-10-minutes-and-you-have-access-to-billion-aadhaar-details-523361)).

### Supreme Court Delivers Final Verdict

**26 September 2018**: The Supreme Court delivers its landmark judgment on the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act in a 4:1 majority decision ([Indian Express, 26 September 2018](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/); [Indian Express, 26 September 2018](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/supreme-court-aadhaar-verdict-some-right-to-privacy-5376298/)). The majority judgment, written by Justice AK Sikri in concurrence with Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice AM Khanwilkar, upholds the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act for welfare schemes, finding it satisfies the proportionality test and serves a legitimate state interest ([Indian Express, 26 September 2018](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/)). However, the court strikes down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act, which allowed private entities (such as banks, telecom companies, and schools) to demand Aadhaar for authentication ([Indian Express, 26 September 2018](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/)). The court sets aside linking Aadhaar to bank accounts and mobile phone numbers, ruling these are not mandatory ([Indian Express, 26 September 2018](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/)). While it upholds seeding of PAN with Aadhaar, it rules Aadhaar is not mandatory for school admissions, CBSE, UGC, and NEET examinations ([Indian Express, 26 September 2018](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/)). Justice DY Chandrachud writes a dissenting opinion, arguing that the entire Aadhaar programme since 2009 suffers from constitutional infirmities and violations of fundamental rights, and that Parliament's passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill amounted to "a fraud on the Constitution" ([Indian Express, 26 September 2018](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/supreme-court-aadhaar-verdict-some-right-to-privacy-5376298/); [iPleaders, 7 June 2019](https://blog.ipleaders.in/aadhar-right-privacy/)). The court also strikes down the National Security Exception under the Aadhaar Act, restricting government access to individual Aadhaar data ([iPleaders, 7 June 2019](https://blog.ipleaders.in/aadhar-right-privacy/)).

## 2019

### Aadhaar Amendment Act Passed

**July 2019**: Parliament passes the Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019, allowing voluntary use of Aadhaar for Know Your Customer (KYC) purposes by banks, telecom companies, and other entities ([Economic Times, July 2019](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/parliament-passes-aadhaar-amendment-bill/articleshow/70129841.cms)). The amendment effectively reinstates some private sector use of Aadhaar through a legislative route, circumventing the Supreme Court's striking down of Section 57. Critics argue this undermines the 2018 Supreme Court judgment.

## 2021

### Voter ID-Aadhaar Linkage Bill Passed

**21 December 2021**: Parliament passes the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which allows for the linking of Voter ID (EPIC - Electoral Photo Identity Card) with Aadhaar on a voluntary basis ([The Hindu, 21 December 2021](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-passes-bill-to-link-voter-id-with-aadhaar/article38006282.ece)). The opposition criticizes the bill for potentially disenfranchising voters, enabling voter profiling, and violating the 2018 Supreme Court judgment that limited Aadhaar's scope ([The Hindu, 21 December 2021](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-passes-bill-to-link-voter-id-with-aadhaar/article38006282.ece); [Down To Earth, 2021](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/governance/should-electoral-id-data-be-linked-to-aadhaar--81138)). Civil liberties groups raise concerns about creating a surveillance apparatus through the linking of electoral and biometric databases.

## 2023

### Face Authentication Technology Launched

**June 2023**: UIDAI rolls out an in-house developed AI/ML-based Face Authentication technology to verify identity ([*The Times of India*, June 2023](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uidai-rolls-out-face-authentication-for-pensioners/articleshow/100845678.cms)). The technology is specifically targeted at pensioners for submitting digital life certificates, offering an alternative to fingerprint-based authentication which can be challenging for elderly citizens.

## 2024

### Security Measures Against Biometric Fraud

**July 2024**: The Ministry of Home Affairs and UIDAI implement robust security measures, including biometric locking and mandatory two-factor authentication, in response to rising Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) frauds such as silicone thumb scams ([Press Information Bureau, July 2024](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2039647); [Business Standard, 12 February 2024](https://www.business-standard.com/finance/news/govt-announces-measures-to-curb-aeps-frauds-124021200895_1.html)). These measures are introduced after multiple cases of biometric cloning for financial fraud are reported across the country.

## 2025

### Extended Deadline for Free Updates

**15 June 2025**: UIDAI extends the deadline for the free update of Aadhaar documents (Proof of Identity and Proof of Address) on the myAadhaar portal to 14 June 2026 ([Indian Express, June 2025](https://indianexpress.com/article/how-to/uidai-extends-free-aadhaar-update-to-june-2026-heres-how-to-do-it-online-10071529/)). This extension allows residents to update their demographic and biometric information without paying any fees.

### New Aadhaar Card Design Proposed

**November 2025**: UIDAI announces plans for a major redesign of Aadhaar cards to enhance privacy ([*The Times of India*, November 2025](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uidai-planning-new-aadhaar-rule-in-december-that-may-change-how-your-aadhar-card-looks/articleshow/125432236.cms); [GoodReturns, November 2025](https://www.goodreturns.in/news/new-aadhaar-rule-coming-in-december-uidai-plans-new-card-showing-only-photo-qr-code-1471103.html)). The proposed design would display only a photograph and a QR code on the card, removing visible personal details such as name, address, and date of birth to minimize identity theft risks ([*The Times of India*, November 2025](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uidai-planning-new-aadhaar-rule-in-december-that-may-change-how-your-aadhar-card-looks/articleshow/125432236.cms)). The proposal is expected to be reviewed in December 2025, with implementation planned for subsequent months.

## Key Themes and Ongoing Issues

Throughout its history, the Aadhaar project has been characterized by several recurring themes:

### Privacy and Surveillance Concerns
From the Standing Committee's rejection in 2011 to the 2017 Right to Privacy judgment and the 2018 data breach, privacy has remained a central concern. Critics argue that the world's largest biometric database poses unprecedented risks of surveillance and profiling.

### Legal and Constitutional Challenges
The passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill, the Supreme Court's striking down of Section 57, and subsequent amendments reflect ongoing tensions between legislative intent and constitutional constraints.

### Data Security
The 2018 Tribune investigation and 2024 biometric fraud cases highlight persistent vulnerabilities in data protection despite UIDAI's assurances. The tension between accessibility for service delivery and security against misuse remains unresolved.

### Exclusion vs. Inclusion
While designed to promote financial inclusion and reduce leakages in welfare delivery, reports of beneficiaries being excluded from essential services due to authentication failures or lack of enrollment have raised questions about the project's net impact on vulnerable populations.

### Function Creep
The expansion of Aadhaar from welfare schemes to PAN cards, bank accounts, mobile numbers, and voter IDs demonstrates "function creep" - the gradual expansion of a system beyond its original purpose, often criticized as mission drift from the project's stated objectives.
