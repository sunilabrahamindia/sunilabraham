## Early life and education

Sunil Abraham was born on 17 June 1973 in India. He attended Clarence High School, Bangalore, completing his schooling in 1989. He later studied industrial engineering and management at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, graduating in 1995. After completing his degree, he worked briefly in the private sector before moving into the non-profit field, where he began exploring how technology could support social and development goals. His early work with the voluntary organisation Samuha introduced him to the possibilities of using low-cost, open technologies to improve communication and coordination in rural contexts. This experience shaped his later commitment to open knowledge and the democratisation of technology.

His father, [A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel](https://sunilabraham.in/amaa/) (1933–1996), was a theologian and educator, and his mother is Ponnamma Abraham (née Thekedath).

## Views

Sunil's approach combines advocacy for openness with a pragmatic understanding of governance and economics. He argues that open-source software, open data, and open standards are essential for democratic participation and transparency, particularly in developing countries. At the same time, he has written critically about the limits of openness when it is detached from local realities or when market concentration undermines public interest. His work reflects a balance between technological optimism and institutional critique.

In 2003, he received the Sarai FLOSS Fellowship for his contributions to the free and open-source software movement within the voluntary sector. His work has been cited in policy reports and international forums concerned with Internet rights, information access, and innovation in public systems.
