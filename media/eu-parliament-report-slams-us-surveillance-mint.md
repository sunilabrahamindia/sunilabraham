<p>New Delhi: A European Union (EU) parliament report that outlines the need for stringent laws for protecting citizen privacy, democratizing Internet governance and rebuilding trust between Europe and the US holds many lessons for India, analysts and policymakers say.</p>

<p>The US government listened into Indian communications as part of its massive global surveillance, which was exposed last year in leaks to the media. The embassies of France, Italy, Greece, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey were also subjected to the surveillance put in place after the September 2001 terrorist attacks. According to the external affairs ministry, India has registered its protest at least thrice over the issue with US authorities.</p>

<p>A draft report on the US National Security Agency's surveillance programme by the European parliament's committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs states that trust between the two transatlantic partners, trust among EU member-states, and trust between citizens and their governments were profoundly shaken because of the spying, and to rebuild trust in all these dimensions a comprehensive plan was urgently needed.</p>

<p>"It is very doubtful that data collection of such magnitude is only guided by the fight against terrorism, as it involves the collection of all possible data of all citizens; points therefore to the possible existence of other power motives such as political and economic espionage," says the report.</p>

<p>The report recommends prohibiting blanket mass surveillance activities and bulk processing of personal data, and asks EU member-states, including the UK, Germany, France, Sweden and the Netherlands, to revise their national legislation and practices governing the activities of intelligence services to ensure that they are in line with the standards of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<p>It also calls on the US to revise its legislation without delay in order to bring it in line with international law, recognizing privacy and other rights as well as providing for judicial redress for EU citizens.</p>

<p>"The American approach to privacy regulation has been deeply flawed. The US dominance over the Internet affects the structure and substance of Internet governance and among other human rights, the right to privacy," said Sunil Abraham, executive director of the Centre for Internet and Society, a Bangalore-based not-for-profit research organization. "The (EU) report, if implemented, may change the future of Internet governance by deepening the existing leadership provided by the EU in promoting their privacy standards globally."</p>

<p>On India's rather restrained reaction to the spying, he said, "It is a tragedy that our politicians are not as proactive when it comes to protecting our rights. While India has only focused on changing its official email policy after the revelations of mass surveillance, it has done nothing as concrete and comprehensive as EU."</p>

<p>"There is neither the recognition of (the) pervasive nature of global mass surveillance, nor is there full appreciation (of) the damaging consequences," Abraham added.</p>

<p>J. Satyanarayana, secretary in India's department of electronics and information technology, said the concerns over privacy are the same for India as for the EU, but declined to comment on what preventive steps the government is implementing due to security reasons. The EU report called for concluding the EU-US umbrella pact, a framework agreement on data protection in the field of police and judicial cooperation, to ensure proper redress mechanisms for EU citizens in the event of data transfers from the EU to the US for law enforcement purposes. The report asks EU policymakers not to initiate any new sectoral agreements or arrangements for the transfer of personal data for law enforcement purposes and suggests suspending the terrorist finance tracking programme until the umbrella agreement negotiations are concluded.</p>

<p>"EU wants to use EU-US umbrella agreement...to raise the US standards, to ensure the rights of EU citizens and perhaps all the citizens. All humans will need protection under US law as is currently the case in the EU," said Abraham. "The prohibition of blanket surveillance that the report recommends will hopefully apply to all citizens regardless of their nationality."</p>

<p>The draft report goes as far as suggesting suspending Safe Harbour, the legal instrument used for the transfer of EU personal data to the US through Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, Apple and LinkedIn, until a full review has been conducted and current loopholes are plugged. The report's proposals and recommendations are likely to be implemented after election to the European parliament in May.</p>

<p>In addition to reforms in the existing systems, the report outlines the importance of development of European clouds as it notes that trust in US cloud computing and cloud services providers has been affected by the surveillance practices.</p>

<p>"Three of the major computerized reservation systems used by airlines worldwide are based in the US and that PNR (passenger name record) data are saved in cloud systems operating on US soil under US law...lacks data protection adequacy," states the report.</p>

<p>C.U. Bhaskar, analyst with the South Asia Monitor think tank, was of the view that India had "adequately" responded to the US through quiet diplomacy. "It is unlikely that the US will give up cyber surveillance," he said, adding, "We should acquire our own capacity to ensure adequate defensive and offensive firewalls and build up appropriate capacity for our cyber programmes."</p>

<p>"Given our expertise in the IT (information technology) sector, as an analyst my opinion is that we have a reasonable capacity to build up our capabilities," Bhaskar added.</p>

## Context and Background

The article was published in the context of the ongoing fallout from the Snowden revelations that had begun in June 2013. By January 2014, the European Parliament's LIBE (Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) committee had produced its draft report, which went considerably further than most government responses in demanding structural reforms to US surveillance law and threatening to suspend Safe Harbour.

Sunil Abraham's observation that the EU report "may change the future of Internet governance" anticipated significant developments in transatlantic data transfer law. The Safe Harbour framework was indeed invalidated — though it took the *Schrems* judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union in October 2015, rather than the European Parliament process, to do so. The EU-US Privacy Shield that replaced it was itself struck down in 2020 (*Schrems II*), and a successor framework, the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, was adopted only in 2023. His criticism of India's response as limited to changes in official email usage referred to the government’s post-Snowden directive asking senior officials to avoid foreign email services. The comparison with the EU’s legislative and diplomatic initiatives underscored the differing institutional responses to the surveillance disclosures.
