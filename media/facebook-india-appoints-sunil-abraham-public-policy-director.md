## Context and Background

This appointment came at a time when Facebook's operations in India were under sustained scrutiny over data governance, platform accountability and regulatory compliance. India was simultaneously advancing major policy frameworks on data protection and intermediary responsibility, making public policy leadership a strategically sensitive role for global technology companies.

Sunil Abraham's background placed him at the intersection of civil society, technology research and policy engagement. His work with non-profit technology initiatives and academic research institutions reflected long-standing involvement in debates on privacy, open technology and governance rather than corporate advocacy alone.

The creation of a dedicated role focused on data and emerging technology signalled Facebook India's attempt to formalise its engagement with regulators, researchers and policy stakeholders. It also reflected the growing importance of structured policy dialogue as platforms navigated increasingly complex regulatory environments in India and the wider South Asia region.
