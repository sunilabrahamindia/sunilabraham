<p>An image showing a high-rise with chipped plaster and cracked walls landed in the Facebook and WhatsApp accounts of apartment owners of Uniworld City, Rajarhat (Kolkata) a couple of hours after Saturday's earthquake. It appeared to be one of the buildings in their complex. Panic-stricken residents and outstation apartment owners began calling the maintenance officer, only to find out that nothing had been damaged barring an elevator door. The image was morphed. "These are malicious rumours being floated by people with vested interests," said Ranjit Chatterjee, the administrative officer.</p>

<p>Social media played an important role in relief and rescue operations during the floods in Uttarakhand in 2013 and Kashmir in 2014, and it is helping relief work in Nepal too, but closer home, its role has been dubious.</p>

<p>Like the Uniworld City flat owners, alumni of Isabella Thornton College in Lucknow were shocked to see WhatsApp images that claimed to be of the damage to their college. "I called up the college and teachers and found out that these were morphed images, the building had not been damaged," said Arpita Bhattacharjee, an alumni.</p>

<p>Clearly, mischief-makers have found in social media a great opportunity to spread panic.</p>

<p>In Bihar a WhatsApp forward which cited NASA to warn of "something bigger than the already experienced earthquakes" in the next 48 hours spread enough scare to force scores of people to spend the night at the Gandhi maidan in Patna. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, according to reports, flew back from Delhi when he heard of the panic and the matter came in Parliament on Monday with telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad telling the House that these rumours needed to be ignored.</p>

<p>"There is no way we can predict earthquakes in the short term," said KM Rao, senior scientist at the Institute of Seismological Research, Gandhinagar. "After a quake of 7.9 magnitude, there is unlikely to be another that is of even bigger scale."</p>

<p>"It's definitely a crisis," said Sunil Abraham, executive director of the Centre for Internet & Society, referring to the misinformation. Abraham sees the phenomenon as a fallout of social media's "attention economy" where a significant number of people would do anything, put up intimate personal information or say outrageous things about something everyone is discussing, giving false data to get all the attention. "There is also the perverse logic that any attention is good attention; they get the same thrill as a stalker," Abraham added.</p>

## Context and Background

This article was published in the immediate aftermath of the April 2015 earthquake in Nepal, which was felt across several parts of northern India. The seismic event led to heightened public anxiety, particularly in regions that experienced tremors, and created conditions in which unverified information circulated rapidly online.

The report documents how morphed images and false warnings spread through social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook. In Bihar, a message falsely attributed to NASA warned of a larger earthquake within 48 hours, prompting many residents in Patna to spend the night at Gandhi Maidan. The panic drew official responses from the Bihar government and was later addressed in Parliament.

While social media had played a constructive role in coordinating relief during earlier disasters such as the Uttarakhand floods in 2013 and the Kashmir floods in 2014, this incident highlighted its capacity to amplify fear when misinformation spreads unchecked. The article situates these events within broader concerns about the speed, scale, and incentives of online communication during emergencies.

Sunil Abraham's remarks in the report frame the issue as a consequence of social media's attention-driven dynamics, where visibility and engagement can encourage sensational or misleading content. The incidents described illustrate how such dynamics can translate into real-world panic, administrative disruption, and public confusion during crisis situations.
