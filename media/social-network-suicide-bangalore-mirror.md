<p>And this is just one of the many reasons why your friend — who was otherwise tweeting her every mundane activity or would update her status message on Facebook every nano-second – might have suddenly become incommunicado.</p>

<p>As pressures to keep up virtual appearances become taxing and unpleasant experiences make social networking sites "not-so-safe" to share intimate details, many young people are opting out of these networks, deactivating their accounts and taking web sanyaas.</p>

<p>Sunil Abraham, Executive Director, Centre for Internet and Society, Bangalore says that in India this is a relatively new phenomenon and only a small group of people have actually committed web suicide using applications that wipe out their virtual identity. But a bigger number of netizens may be killing their networking accounts, because of a variety of reasons – ranging from internet stalking to "no guaranteed benefits."</p>

<p>"Many people may get onto a social networking site to use it for meeting rituals, to look for partners and to get information on jobs. When these are fulfilled they may decide to move out. Some people realise that a lot of their time and energy goes into updating accounts on Facebook, Twitter or Myspace, but it has not helped them get 'real world' benefits, so they just stop being active," says Abraham.</p>

<h3>Virtual disappearance</h3>

<p>With the deactivation came some applications which help you go peacefully into a social network death – Web 2.0 Suicide Machine and Sepukkoo.com promise to remove your virtual identity completely so that you can make real friends. While Suicide Machine irreversibly removes all your friends, groups, photos and videos one by one and joins you to its "Social Network Suiciders," Sepukkoo goes one step ahead and creates a memorial page for you.</p>

<p>What is ironical is that you are actually going to another network and this one is called "suicide networking", where you encourage friends to leave their social circles. Both applications have been banned by Facebook but work on other sites.</p>

<p>So why would a popular guy deactivate his account? Joe V J, a 28-year-old IT professional, who was regularly uploading pictures of his new bike or parties with friends on Facebook, took himself off the site recently. He realised that people who were not meant to see his profile and candid shots had access and were posting comments.</p>

<p>"I got into the site because it was a great place to bond with friends. But then I realised that relatives and acquaintances who I had no clue about, were on the social network, had started pinging. They would look at pictures and express shock and then tell other people. It became a little too much, so I just decided to click the deactivate option," he says.</p>

<h3>Privacy concerns</h3>

<p>It can get really ugly and those being harassed online may just disappear to save their privacy. Tinu Cherian, a techie and Wikipedia administrator, speaks of an incident where another administrator was harassed by a cyber troll because he had blocked this guy from making wrong updates on Wiki's pages.</p>

<p>"He had no option but to wipe out his Twitter account, which was hacked into and damning information was uploaded."</p>

<p>Privacy concerns rise as Facebook decides to share account information with marketeers. "When Facebook first started, only 10 per cent of your information on the site could be seen by an outsider, but in 2011, 90 per cent of your information can be accessed by people other than your friends," says Abraham.</p>

<p>There is another reason why people go off online networks. "When it first came, Facebook was considered the Ivy league and everyone wanted to be there. Youngsters suddenly thought Orkut was infradig and ceased to be on that site. So sometimes, people may just move out because they want to be somewhere else." And that is why the networking tamasha continues.</p>

## Context and Background

The feature appeared when Facebook was rapidly eclipsing Orkut in India and social media use was spreading beyond early adopters, bringing new tensions around privacy, stalking and reputational risk. It reflects an early moment when some users began to see deactivation or "web sanyaas" as a deliberate way to reclaim time and control rather than simply drifting away from a platform.

Sunil Abraham's comments link "social network suicide" to unmet expectations and shifting platform norms, suggesting that people often leave once they have found jobs, partners or contacts, or when constant posting fails to deliver tangible offline benefits. His observation about Facebook's expanding visibility and data sharing underlines how design and policy choices by platforms can push users towards exit when they feel overexposed to strangers and marketers.
