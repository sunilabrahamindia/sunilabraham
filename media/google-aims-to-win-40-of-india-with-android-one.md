<p>BANGALORE: When Google launches its low-cost Android One devices next Monday, Indian users will be able to give voice commands, type messages and use almost all major mobile applications in Hindi. This is because the California, US based internet giant is hoping that the devices, which have been tailor-made for emerging markets, will help it capture the non-English speaking user base in the country.</p>

<p>Over 40 per cent of the population in India lists Hindi as its first language. Android One will come bundled with local language support and users will not have to download any external application to access their smartphone in Hindi, a person with knowledge of the development told ET.</p>

<p>"Google has been constantly working on developing more salience around Indic computing, providing regional language support to users for its various products and services," a Google spokesman said in an email. Internet users in India could increase by nearly a fourth if local language content is provided, according to a 2014 report from Internet and Mobile Association of India and IMRB International.</p>

<p>In rural India, 43 per cent said they would adopt the Internet if they had content in their local language. Local language consumption growth is estimated to be more than four times that of English, according to Google. The company is trying to take a lead over its competitors by taking advantage of this trend.</p>

<p>Google is working to create more Hindi content online through local partnerships and is expected to launch more products keeping the Indic audience in mind.</p>

<p>"So far different vendors were offering different ingredients of the Indian language meal and users were expected to cook it themselves," said Venkatesh Hariharan, founder of Alchemy Business Solutions, a company which works on Indic computing and technology for development.</p>

<p>"If Google offers a comprehensive experience that works out-of-the-box in Indian languages that could attract millions of new users." Indic computing has so far been limited to enthusiasts who had to download a keyboard from one site, a local language dictionary from another and fonts from a third.</p>

<p>"If we really want widespread adoption, then using a mobile phone in Indian languages should be as easy as using it in English," Hariharan said. This is what Google hopes to achieve by introducing devices in partnership with Indian handset makers Micromax, Spice and Karbonn, which will launch the Android One devices for Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 next week.</p>

<p>The availability of such devices will also help internet companies such as Facebook and Yahoo promote their products in Indian languages. Facebook currently supports 13 Indian languages. "We are focused on enabling all major Indic languages and on actively promoting them on various platforms," a Facebook spokesperson said.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Yahoo shifted its multilingual support from websites to only mobile apps. For instance, the Yahoo Mail mobile app supports eight Indian languages.</p>

<p>"We can confirm we recently closed down the Indian language sites to better focus on our core offerings," a Yahoo representative said. While experts welcomed Google's push towards Hindi, some want the technologies to be open source.</p>

<p>"Now you'll have some people who will specialise on building Indic computing tools on Google and others doing the same on some other platform," said Sunil Abraham, executive director of Bangalore based research organisation, The Centre for Internet and Society. "At least Google, which seems to have understood and taken advantage of free software, should give back to the free software movement."</p>

## Context and Background

Android One's 2014 launch represented Google's attempt to address a persistent barrier to internet adoption in India: language. With over 40% of the population listing Hindi as their primary language, the fragmented approach to vernacular computing—requiring users to separately source keyboards, dictionaries, and fonts—had effectively excluded millions from meaningful smartphone use. Google's strategy of bundling comprehensive Hindi support directly into budget devices priced at ₹5,000–7,000 aimed to eliminate this friction entirely.

Venkatesh Hariharan's observation that users were previously expected to "cook the meal themselves" highlighted how Indic computing had remained confined to technically proficient enthusiasts. The Android One approach marked a shift towards treating vernacular language support as default infrastructure rather than optional add-ons, potentially expanding India's internet user base by roughly 25% according to IAMAI-IMRB research.

Sunil Abraham's commentary raised broader questions about technological sovereignty and the implications of proprietary language tools. His concern that developers would become platform-specific—some specialising in Google's Indic tools, others on competing systems—pointed to fragmentation risks even as vernacular access expanded. His appeal for Google to contribute language technologies back to open-source communities reflected ongoing tensions between commercial platform development and the collaborative ethos that had historically driven localisation efforts.

The article captured a transitional moment when major technology companies began viewing India's linguistic diversity as market opportunity rather than technical obstacle. Facebook's support for 13 Indian languages and Yahoo's mobile-focused vernacular strategy indicated industry-wide recognition that English-only interfaces severely limited addressable markets. However, the shift from open web-based language tools to proprietary mobile platforms raised questions about long-term control over digital language infrastructure.

Google's partnerships with Micromax, Spice, and Karbonn—Indian manufacturers competing against established players—demonstrated how language localisation intersected with industrial policy and market dynamics. By enabling these companies to offer feature-competitive devices at accessible price points, Android One potentially democratised smartphone access whilst simultaneously expanding Google's ecosystem reach into previously underserved demographics.
