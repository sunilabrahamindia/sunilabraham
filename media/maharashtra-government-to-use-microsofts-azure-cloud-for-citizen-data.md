**Maharashtra Government to Use Microsoft's Azure Cloud for Citizen Data** is a report published in *The Economic Times* on 4 February 2015. It examines the state's decision to pilot the digital-locker scheme using Microsoft's Azure public cloud infrastructure. While the programme aims to streamline citizen services by linking digital documents to Aadhaar, experts—including Sunil Abraham—raise concerns about centralised storage, access control and privacy safeguards.

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br>
The digital-locker scheme is one of the planks of Modi's Digital India programme, which is expected to improve governance by delivering some govt services online.</p>

<p><strong>MUMBAI:</strong> The Maharashtra government's plans to use Microsoft's Azure public cloud to store citizen data under the digital-locker scheme that will be linked to user's Aadhaar number. This is to ease services delivery to citizens, but privacy experts say putting private data on a public cloud without enough safeguards will be a terrible idea.</p>

<p>The digital-locker scheme is one of the planks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's DigitalIndia programme, which is expected to improve governance by helping deliver some government services online. The scheme envisions placing educational, medical, passport and PAN card details in a digital form to access services.</p>

<p>Late last week, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said Microsoft would be setting up South Asia's biggest data centres in Mumbai and Pune and these data centres would be used to start a digital-locker pilot project.</p>

<p>"This system will be linked with UID (Unique Identification Number, or Aadhaar); all information would be seeded with the digital identity and will help get public services. The digital information would be secure in digital lockers," Fadnavis said.</p>

<p>However, the state announced only sketchy details of how the information would be protected and structured. When asked for clarification, Microsoft merely pointed to a link saying the firm would offer its Office 365 and Azure services from local data centres by the end of 2015.</p>

<p>The lack of detail is raising concerns among privacy experts. While the placing of public documents — such as PAN, educational certificates and ration cards — on the public cloud is non-controversial, doing so with private documents like a person's passport and medical information is a completely different concept. "It looks like both Microsoft and the state will have unfettered access to all the contents of the digital locker of each citizen, including personal information. This is a terrible idea because it is centralising storage of personal information across silos controlled by different data controllers," said Sunil Abraham, executive director of Centre for Internet & Society.</p>

<p>He said ideally this should have been done by keeping personal data with each data controller and then have different government entities combine data on an express basis.</p>

<p>Some other experts say the state may create appropriate safeguards. "The earlier pilot was out of the state data centre. This pilot has just been announced. I am sure the safeguards will be put in place," said a consultant, who advises the government on IT projects. He declined to be identified.</p>

<p>The principal secretary for IT in the Maharashtra government, Ajoy Mehta, and the IT director, Virendra Singh, could not be reached for comment despite a number of calls to their offices.</p>

## Context and Background

This article highlights a pivotal moment in India's early Digital India rollout, when state governments were experimenting with cloud-based infrastructure for citizen-facing services. The digital-locker concept promised convenience and reduced paperwork, but also introduced risks related to centralisation, cross-controller access, and unclear technical safeguards.

Sunil Abraham's critique emphasises a core principle of privacy-respecting architecture: personal data should remain with the controller that originally collected it, rather than being funnelled into a large, shared repository. His concerns foreshadow later debates on data localisation, federation vs. centralisation, and proportionality in public digital infrastructure.

The report underscores how early cloud deployments—especially via private multinational providers—raised governance and accountability questions that India continues to grapple with as digital public infrastructure evolves.
