<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br>
India may be some distance away from such a credit-scoring system, but the increased use of online transactions – financial or otherwise – is sure to lead to similar business models.</p>

<p><strong>NEW DELHI:</strong> Even as demonetisation pushes for more cashless and online transactions through, ewallets, banks, and other such apps, there is a serious lack of clarity on how these companies handle customer data, and how it is shared with other entities.</p>

<p>"Data is the new oil," is an oft repeated phrase in nearly every technology-related conversation that comes up anywhere in India today. However, the handling of this data, most of which carries some of our most personal information, has little protection if it is misused by a private or government entities.</p>

<p>Sample this: At an industry event, a Bengaluru-based startup claimed to solve the problem of credit worthiness of individuals for small loans by using some unusual means. To determine credit worthiness, the company maps everything in your phone — right from how many SMSes you receive for non-payment of dues, to how you fill out your loan application form. The company also claims that it can map, using your phone data, the area of your residence and office.</p>

<p>There are several other companies, especially those in the financial technology (fintech) space, doing similar mapping.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that more than three dozen local governments across China are compiling digital records of social and financial behaviour to rate credit worthiness. A person gets a score deduction for violations such as fare cheating, jaywalking and violating family-planning rules.</p>

<p>India may be some distance away from such a credit-scoring system, but the increased use of online transactions — financial or otherwise — is sure to lead to similar business models.</p>

<p>"You have no clue what data you are sharing with fintech companies. They are collecting data from other sources and combining it to assess your credit score," said Sunil Abraham, executive director of the Centre for Internet Society.</p>

<p>For example, there is no clarity on what an ewallet company does with your details and transaction history even after you delete the app. "If there is large level of customer migration of users from an app company, they will just become a data analytics company. The bigger danger in future (is) the growth of large data intermediaries which are similar to Visa and Mastercard networks, which purchase big databases and further sell this data and build their services or product on top of that. There are large privacy concerns there," said Apar Gupta, advocate and Internet policy expert.</p>

<p>While the lack of a privacy law or controller has been a long standing concern, the existing law for data protection — Section 43(A) of the Information Technology Act — also offers only very basic protection and is "grossly inadequate", according to Abraham.</p>

<p>To make matters worse is that they also lack a strict enforcement mechanism. "We don't know what are the data practices (adopted by apps). There is no privacy controller or some other body, so it is very difficult for a user to know what are the actual ways their data is being implemented," said Gupta.</p>

## Context and Background

This article was published when India was undergoing a dramatic shift toward digital payments due to the 2016 demonetisation policy. The rapid adoption of e-wallets, app-based transactions, and fintech services raised urgent questions about privacy, security, and the misuse of behavioural data.

The experts quoted — including Sunil Abraham and Apar Gupta — draw attention to emerging credit-scoring models based on intrusive phone-data extraction, weak data-protection laws, and the absence of a privacy regulator. Their concerns foreshadow debates that would intensify in later years around data intermediaries, profiling, digital lending, and the need for a robust national privacy framework.
