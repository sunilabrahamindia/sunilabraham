<p>Facebook on Monday said it has appointed Sunil Abraham as the Public Policy Director for Data and Emerging Tech, to lead and shape the company's stance on tech policy issues in India.</p>

<p>Reporting to the Public Policy Director, he will be responsible for building partnerships and engagements with key stakeholders in the public policy area of data privacy, consumer protection, and AI led innovation for new products and services, Facebook said in a statement.</p>

<p>As part of the public policy leadership team, Abraham will contribute to important policy development initiatives and proceedings in India and the South Asia region on data protection, privacy, new and emerging tech and represent Facebook's position in these multi-stakeholder processes, it said.</p>

<p>"Sunil's experience in the field of technology policy and his vast research on data reforms are an ideal fit for Facebook. With his expertise and experience, he will help us in our mission to build transparency, accountability and empowered communities," said Ankhi Das, Public Policy Director, Facebook -India, South & Central Asia.</p>

<p><strong>Wrangle over WSJ report</strong></p>

<p>Recently, there was a political storm over a Wall Street Journal report, which had alleged that Facebook had ignored extremist posts by BJP leaders.</p>

<p>However, Facebook had rejected charges that decisions were being influenced by political leanings of individuals, saying the process followed at the platform is designed to ensure no one person can influence outcomes, let alone take any unilateral decisions.</p>

<p>Abraham will be reporting to Das. He has almost 25 years experience in working with Indian and global civil society organisations. In 1998, he co-founded Mahiti Infotech, an open technology service provider for the nonprofit sector, and in 2008, he co-founded the Centre for Internet and Society, a policy and academic research organisation focusing on accessibility, openness, access to knowledge, Internet governance, digital humanities and telecom regulation.</p>

<p>He has been an advocate of the free/open source software and was a part of the Wikimedia movement starting in 2004 when he co-managed the International Open Source Network for UNDP. Most recently he spent a year as Endowed Professor at ArtEZ University for the Arts in the Netherlands.</p>

## Context and Background

This appointment occurred during a period of intense political and regulatory pressure on Facebook in India. A Wall Street Journal investigation in August 2020 had alleged that Facebook's senior India policy executive, Ankhi Das, opposed enforcing hate speech rules against members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, raising concerns about the platform's neutrality and commitment to content moderation standards.

The revelations led to parliamentary scrutiny, with India's standing committee on information technology summoning Facebook India's managing director to address concerns about platform governance and user safety. Das herself resigned from Facebook weeks after Abraham's appointment.

Sunil's appointment was positioned as part of Facebook's effort to strengthen its engagement with Indian policymakers on data protection, privacy frameworks, and artificial intelligence regulation. His extensive background in civil society work, particularly through the Centre for Internet and Society, and his advocacy for open-source software and digital rights, represented a shift in the company's approach to public policy in the region during this contentious period.
