<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br>
Co's latest strategy comes at a time when online firms have been attempting to raise their ad revenues by personalising ads to attract attention.</p>

<p><strong>BANGALORE/NEW DELHI:</strong> Google's recent privacy policy change that allows the internet search company to use names, photographs and endorsements by its users in online advertisements is getting mixed reviews in India - advertisers love it, and activists love to hate it. Internet rights activists called it another incursion into individual privacy by the California-based company that uses 'Don't be evil' as an informal corporate motto. Brand advisers and marketers praised the ingenuity of personalisation that can make advertising much more effective.</p>

<p>"From a user perspective, there is a higher chance of them buying a product if it is endorsed by a friend," said Kunal Jeswani, chief digital officer at Ogilvy & Mather India. To his mind, the argument about user privacy is "naive" because when a user enters a social network, he/she should know his/her personal information, such as profile photographs and names, is already on the web.</p> 

<p>Google announced its policy change regarding user information will be effective on November 11, giving the company the right to use profile names, photos and comments alongside advertisements by clients who use its online advertising network of over 2 million websites.</p>

<p>For instance, if a user has endorsed a product by giving it a "+1" or rated a product on the Google Play app store, his/her image will appear next to the ad when it is displayed to people who are part of his/her social circle on the social networking service Google Plus. The move is seen as Google's attempt to catch up with rival Facebook, which first introduced the concept of 'social ads' that let corporations use the power of influence of people within a person's social network to sell products.</p>

<p>Internet rights activists said such practices raise privacy concerns as they do not take prior consent of users.</p>

<p>"We are not comfortable with user information being used without their permission, especially since Google's privacy standards are not very high," said Uday Mehta, associate director at Consumer Unity and Trust Society (CUTS International).</p>

<p>Last year, the agency complained to Competition Commission of India to investigate Google's alleged anti-competitive practices here. An investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>In an emailed response, Google said it is notifying users about the change in policy, so that if a user does not like it, he/she can turn it off.</p>

<p>"Since we're updating an existing setting, we will continue to respect the choice you made about the old setting. That means if you already told us that you didn't want your +1s to appear in ads, none of your other shared endorsements will appear in ads," a Google spokesman said.</p>

<p>For example, Google said, if a user reviewed a restaurant, people who aren't in his/her Google Plus Circles of friends would not see that review in an ad that the restaurant might run through Google.</p>

<p>The latest ad strategy comes at a time when companies such as Google and Facebook have been attempting to increase their ad revenues by personalising advertisements to attract user attention. Over 90% of Google's $46-billion revenue in 2012 came from advertisements.</p>

<p>Sunil Abraham, executive director of the Center for Internet and Society said the issue highlights the need for a stronger internet privacy statute in India. The absence of clear privacy laws makes it impossible for government officials to understand the harm caused to personal rights because of the default settings of Google, he observed.</p>

## Context and Background

Google's shift towards personalised endorsements echoed broader global trends in ad-tech, where platforms increasingly rely on social signals to improve ad performance. The Indian advertising industry welcomed this move, viewing personalised endorsements as more persuasive and attention-grabbing. Privacy advocates, however, pointed to inadequate user consent mechanisms and the absence of a robust legal framework in India to address harms arising from default settings and commercial data use.

Sunil Abraham's comments underscored a structural regulatory challenge: without a comprehensive privacy law, India's institutions lack the tools needed to evaluate and mitigate risks posed by platform-driven data practices.
