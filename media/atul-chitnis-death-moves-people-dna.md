<div class="highlighted-text" id="fulltext">

<p>Some called him visionary, others opinionated. He chose to call himself an "irrationally committed product guy".</p>

<p>Atul Chitnis passed away on June 3, at the age of 51, after losing a 10-month-long battle with advanced intestinal cancer. A passionate technologist and amateur cook, the lively Chitnis spent much of his life in making open source software accessible to everyone. He was diagnosed with the disease in August 2012 and was under chemotherapy.</p>

<p>He was also a columnist and consulting editor for PCQuest magazine, co-founder of RadioVeRVe and founder of FOSS.IN.</p>

<p>Remembered for his insightful writings and blog posts, it is difficult to single out a <a href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/atulchitnis">specific achievement</a> from the prolific man. He touched the lives of people whom he met, whom he was yet to meet and whom he will now never meet.</p>

<p>Here are some tweets expressing grief over his death and bidding him a final goodbye.</p>

<p>"You aren't remembered for doing what is expected of you."</p>

## Context and Background

This article was published the day Atul Chitnis died, capturing immediate reactions from friends, collaborators, and members of India's technology community. Chitnis had been a central figure in the Indian free and open source software ecosystem for decades, particularly through his leadership of the FOSS.IN conference and earlier Linux events.

Beyond conference organising, he influenced developers and technologists through his work at PCQuest, his writing, and his advocacy for open systems at a time when proprietary platforms dominated. His visibility on early Indian online forums, blogs, and social media meant that many who mourned him had known him primarily through digital spaces rather than direct personal contact.

The social media tributes highlighted both the technical and personal dimensions of his legacy. Posts from colleagues and younger technologists remembered him as a demanding product thinker, an outspoken commentator, and a generous mentor who helped shape attitudes towards software freedom and product design in India.

The article's focus on Twitter reactions reflects a broader shift in how public figures' deaths were being marked in the early 2010s. Platforms like Twitter had become primary spaces for collective remembrance, allowing geographically dispersed communities to share memories, express grief, and situate an individual's contribution within a wider professional and cultural context.
