## Context and Background

The Policy 50 feature appears at a time when India's digital policy landscape is expanding rapidly across domains such as AI, data protection, digital public infrastructure, and platform regulation. By curating 50 individuals, *MIT Sloan Management Review India* aims to map the human layer behind these changes—ministers, regulators, mission directors, corporate policy leads, academics, and civil society advocates who shape how technology interacts with the economy and society.

Lists of this kind are necessarily selective and interpretive. They reflect an editorial judgement about which roles and institutions most influence the trajectory of India's digital governance at a particular moment rather than constituting an exhaustive or definitive ranking. The inclusion of both government officials and independent researchers underscores that policy in this space is being negotiated across multiple centres of expertise and power.

Sunil Abraham's presence in the list highlights a career spent at the intersection of digital rights, public interest technology, and corporate policy. His earlier work at the Centre for Internet and Society helped frame Indian debates on issues such as privacy, surveillance, copyright, and access to knowledge. His subsequent role at Meta India places him inside a large global platform, where questions of competition, online safety, and regulatory compliance are central.

At the same time, the feature indirectly points to gaps that remain under‑addressed in many policy conversations: everyday perspectives of marginalised users, regional diversity in digital access and governance, and long‑term implications of data‑driven systems for democratic accountability. For researchers and practitioners working on technology and society, the Policy 50 list is therefore best read as a snapshot of one influential cross‑section of actors rather than a complete picture of India's digital future.
