<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br>
The Twitter handle, @PMOIndia, begun during the tenure of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, was changed to @PMOIndiaArchive on Tuesday.</p>

<p>NEW DELHI: On Tuesday afternoon, as Narendra Modi rode into Rashtrapati Bhavan to stake claim to form government, the office of his predecessor Manmohan Singh renamed the prime minister's Twitter handle, and an unknown person acquired the original name, in what the incoming regime called an "uncalled-for parting gift by the PMO".</p>

<p>"Victory and defeat is now a matter of the past. Today we stand here as one, as a nation of a billion Indians and have to work for the poor of the nation. This 'parting gift' by the PMO Twitter handle is uncalled for," a person working closely with the PMdesignate told ET.</p>

<p>For reasons the PMO did not officially explain, the microblogging account @PMOIndia, with over 1.24 million followers, was renamed to @PMOIndiaArchive. The tweets were archived, and its 1.24 million followers shifted to the new handle.</p>

<p>The new handle tweeted, "The account @PMOIndiaArchive has been created to archive all the tweets, photos and other digital footprints of UPA Govt under Dr. Manmohan Singh. As per @PMOIndiaArchive, PM's tweets and blog will be available as archival material under the RTI Act for @PMOIndia till 20/5/2014. @PMOIndia will be available shortly."</p>

<p>Shortly after, the original handle was taken by an unknown person. "I took the name of respected @PMOIndiaArchive (@pmoindia)," tweeted one Qaiser Ali (see screenshot). The tweet and profile pictures were later deleted, but some 6,900 people were already following this handle. BJP officials, which have won the recently concluded national elections under the leadership of Modi, were furious at this "ungrateful, ungraceful, unethical and illegal" move. "The Twitter handle @PMOIndia is not a personal handle. It is an official handle of the office of the prime minister of India," the person working with Modi said.</p>

<p>"Continuity in governance is the hallmark of the Constitution. This continuity is reflected in how all aspects of the office of the prime minister are transitioned. The Twitter handle @PMOIndia is a national digital asset that should see the same continuity in governance."</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the outgoing PMO did not show the grace to transition this national asset in a clean manner," he said. Arvind Gupta, national head of BJP's IT cell, said, "It is not their property but an institutional asset, that is, a property of the PMO.</p>

<p>We wonder what message they are trying to send out with this move." A PMO official insisted the move was procedural. "We are archiving all the communication, so naturally the Twitter handle will also be archived.</p>

<p>We have surrendered the account to Twitter by doing so and the @PMOIndia remains with the PMO." On the point that the 1.24 million followers have gone to the archived handle, he said, "The followers will go to the new Twitter handle on their own." The official said he was leaving office and would not want to be named.</p>

<p>@PMOIndia was set up on January 23, 2012, after TV journalist Pankaj Pachauri became the media advisor to PM Manmohan Singh. Till its closure, PMO had tweeted 4,506 times and followed 44 persons, many of whom were leaders of the Congress party, which Singh represented. Twitter users often used the handle to express their gratitude, anger and respect for the Manmohan Singh.</p>

<p>Gupta said PMO should have followed the right procedures for handing over their digital assets. "Ideally, they should have archived all the tweets and other material and put it up on some website for people to see, instead of renaming the handle," he added.</p>

<p>Sunil Abraham, executive director of the Centre for Internet and Society, a non-profit research organisation that works on policy issues relating to freedom of expression and privacy, agreed. "Digital assets of the government should be tied to positions and not individuals," he said.</p>

## Context and Background

This May 2014 incident occurred during India's historic transfer of power following the BJP's decisive electoral victory, marking the first time since independence that a single party won an absolute parliamentary majority after three decades of coalition governments. The @PMOIndia handle controversy crystallised emerging questions about how democratic institutions should manage digital assets during political transitions—issues that had rarely been tested given social media's relative novelty in government communications.

Sunil Abraham's observation that government digital assets should be "tied to positions and not individuals" articulated a principle of institutional continuity that India's administrative frameworks had not yet codified. The outgoing PMO's decision to rename rather than transfer the handle reflected uncertainty about whether the account represented an archival record of a specific administration's communications or an ongoing institutional presence transcending individual governments. This confusion mirrored broader ambiguities in how democracies worldwide were navigating social media's role in official communications.

The fact that an unknown individual—identified as Qaiser Ali—could immediately claim the vacated @PMOIndia username exposed Twitter's platform governance gaps. The handle had accumulated 1.24 million followers over two years, representing significant communicative reach and public trust associated with India's highest executive office. That this digital asset could be appropriated by a private citizen during a crucial governmental transition demonstrated how platform policies designed for individual users failed to account for sovereign institutional accounts.

BJP officials' characterisation of the move as "ungrateful, ungraceful, unethical and illegal" reflected their perception that the outgoing administration had deliberately created confusion rather than following unstated norms of smooth transition. The invocation of "continuity in governance" as a constitutional hallmark suggested the incoming government viewed the handle's treatment as symptomatic of broader resistance to seamless power transfer. Whether the outgoing PMO's actions stemmed from archival instincts, procedural confusion, or subtle obstruction remained contested.

The episode illustrated how digital governance required establishing new conventions paralleling physical transfer protocols—much as office keys, files, and official residences moved between administrations according to established procedures, digital assets needed comparable transition frameworks. India subsequently developed clearer protocols for handling government social media accounts during political transitions, treating them as institutional rather than personal properties that persist across administrations whilst archiving previous content appropriately.
