<p><em>Once you're gone, who handles your digital accounts? Maybe it's time for a digital will.</em></p>

<hr class="article-separator">

<p>Jayaram Perumal is just 25 years old and has already made a will for himself. Jayaram does not own a house or land, nor does he have a huge bank balance. His will does not mention any physical asset of his but instead gives details of his digital assets.</p>

<p>Jayaram has written a will using the site Securesafe, where he has given details of all his login ids as well as passwords for the same. Jayaram has mentioned around four accounts of his that include Facebook, Twitter, Gmail and Yahoo and has nominated his close friend to receive their details after his death.</p>

<p>Jayaram is an artist. He paints and writes poems. Every idea, every single line of his poem is stored in his Gmail account.</p>

<p>Jayaram, who stays in Bannashankari, said, "I paint as a professional artist, and writing poems is my hobby. While my paintings are known to the world, my poems are not. If at all something does happen to me, I want my close ones to know about my work. All my data is available on these accounts and hence I want it to be accessible to my family. The feature is free of cost so why not use it."</p>

<p>While for Jayaram, it is about bringing out to his family work he wishes to show after he is dead, for some it is about not leaving anything incomplete. Muniya Dasaraja is a musician (he plays the didgeridoo) and is a member of a band called Agnii, art for all. Muniya and his band members have all made wills for their social life. As the band wants to make sure even if one member is not available the music does not stop, they have made wills and nominated each other in it. The trend is currently visible more among young professionals.</p>

<p>Muniya, 26, who stays at Jayanagar, said, "The only asset I have that has some value is my music. I generally make multiple copies of my work. I store it on my laptop and an external storage device as well. But I feel the most secure way to have a copy is storing it online. I have made several security levels for my accounts and hence it is unlikely to get hacked. But if I die or even for some reason am not able to work or communicate anymore, I would want my band members to know what I wished to do with the content. Hence, I used Afternote.com, the website that allows me to not only give passwords but also mention what my last wishes are. I have made sure that if my account is inactive more than two months, my details will reach my nominee."</p>

<p>Internet experts feel the trend of creating digital wills has been increasing and there are two different reasons for people to create wills. Sunil Abraham, the executive director of Centre of Internet and Society, says that people either create wills for digital assets that have economic value or to share personal information.</p>

<p>Sunil Abraham said, "Digital assets such as films, movies, books and Bitcoins are of value and it makes sense to have a will. However, the passwords can also reveal personal information about the person. This depends on the person's choice whether they wish to do it or not."</p>

<p>Sunil added, "A youngster creating a will and nominating his girlfriend can also be a symbol of trust. Youngsters can use the will as medium to convey importance of a particular person in their life, which is also a good gesture."</p>

<p>Some have even created separate accounts to store their professional work and personal life. Tanvi Shah, 22, a resident of Indiranagar, pursues photography as a hobby. Tanvi has also made a digital will for herself but does not mention all her passwords there.</p>

<p>Tanvi, who is an IT professional, said, "I would love my photographs to be shared with my family, so that they have a copy of my work. My family might keep those to remember me, but at the same time, I do not want my personal conversation to come out. I believe that it would be unfair for the second person in the conversation. Hence, I have made a separate account to store my photos and mentioned only those details in the will. I want my conversations to disappear with me."</p>

<p><strong>WILLING AND ABLE</strong><br>
A digital will is an option through which a person can choose a nominee who will get the details of his or her digital assets. The person can give details of user ID and passwords of all their online accounts be it social media accounts or email IDs in the will. The person can also set instructions on whether or not her/his account should be active post her/his death. Through the will, a person can even give instructions to delete their account after their death without making any nominee.</p>

## Context and Background

The feature appeared at a time when services such as Securesafe and Afternote were promoting tools for storing passwords and sending posthumous messages, reflecting growing concern about what happens to email and social media accounts after death. For many young users, these services offered a way to treat online work and correspondence as something that could be passed on, much like physical property.

Sunil Abraham's comments in the piece distinguish between digital assets with clear economic value, such as films, books or cryptocurrencies, and more intimate material where passing on passwords may expose personal information about both account holders and their contacts. The experiences of Jayaram, Muniya and Tanvi show how some users try to balance remembrance, continuity of creative work and privacy by separating accounts and choosing carefully which credentials to include in their digital wills.
