## Context and Background

The Global Commission on Internet Governance (GCIG) was launched to develop policy recommendations on the future of Internet governance during a period of intense global debate about surveillance, privacy, cyber security and multi-stakeholder governance. The inclusion of Subimal Bhattacharjee and Sunil Abraham placed India at a significant juncture in these global discussions.

The Research Advisory Network (RAN), which both were appointed to, contributed expert analysis and briefings for the commission's final report. Their involvement reflects India's growing contribution to international Internet policy debates, especially around cyber security, governance frameworks and the rights-oriented approach to technology regulation.
