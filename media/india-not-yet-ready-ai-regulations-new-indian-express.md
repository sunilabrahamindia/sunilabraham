<p>HYDERABAD: On the second day of the Global AI Summit 2024 at HICC, experts from various fields discussed key aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>In the panel discussion on 'Building Trust into AI Systems', experts emphasised the importance of transparent, ethical and accountable AI practices. Opinions varied on how to adapt regulations similar to the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act.</p>

<p>Arghya Sengupta, Founder & Research Director of Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, said that India is not yet ready for AI regulations and that small innovators and developers could be most affected and recommended adopting certain codes of practice to make AI more responsible.</p>

<p>Sunil Abraham, Public Policy Director, Data Governance & Emerging Technologies at Meta, stressed the importance of focusing on model development, with developers playing a key role in creating AI models.</p>

<p>Experts from Georgia University discussed how AI could improve society by integrating technology into daily life and governance.</p>

<p>Dr Devesh Ranjan, Eugene C Gwaltney, Jr School Chair and Professor, George W Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, highlighted five areas where AI could enhance services in India: improving government services (natural disaster and risk assessment), increasing access to services (digital extensions for farmers), maximising effectiveness of frontline workers (upskilling Anganwadi workers and healthcare professionals), reducing bias and boosting government capacity.</p>

## Context and Background

This article captured discussions at the Global AI Summit 2024 held at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre. The timing coincided with global debates on AI regulation following the European Union's adoption of the AI Act, which established risk-based frameworks for algorithmic accountability.

Panellists diverged on regulatory approaches for India. Arghya Sengupta from Vidhi Centre argued that premature regulations could burden smaller innovators, advocating instead for industry-led codes of practice. Sunil Abraham, speaking in his capacity at Meta, emphasised the importance of model development and the central role played by developers in shaping AI systems.

Experts from Georgia Institute of Technology proposed practical applications for India's governance challenges, ranging from disaster management systems to agricultural extension services and frontline worker capacity building. The panel reflected broader tensions between innovation imperatives and regulatory safeguards in emerging technology ecosystems, particularly in contexts where institutional capacity and digital infrastructure remain unevenly distributed.
