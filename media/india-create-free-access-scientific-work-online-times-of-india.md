<p>MUMBAI: If knowledge is power, then the departments of bio-technology and science and technology are readying to share it by giving unrestricted access to research work funded by them. According to a new draft open access policy, researchers will soon have to deposit their works in an online repository.</p>

<p>According to the draft policy, once a manuscript makes it to a peer-reviewed professional journal, it should be deposited in a bank at the researcher's institution or with a central repository to be created by the government.</p>

<p>"The University of Southampton in UK was the first to create such a bank. Now, Harvard, MIT and several institutions also have adopted it," says Subbiah Arunachalam, an open access proponent and a member of the core committee that drafted the policy.</p>

<p>Besides helping students and teachers, the repository will be of use to such universities as are unable to lay their hands on all the costly academic journals.</p>

<p>The draft policy, available on dbtindia.nic.in, says all papers funded by the two departments in 2012–13 should also be placed online.</p>

<p>Researchers who do not comply without valid reasons will not be considered for future grants, says the document, which is open for public comments till July 25. For those in government service, non-compliance will lead to their papers not being counted for promotion, tenure and fellowship opportunities.</p>

<p>"The idea is that taxpayers shouldn't pay twice to access research funded by taxpayers' money. If these works ends up in proprietary journals, we have to pay again to read them," says Sunil Abraham, executive director of Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), which helped in the drafting of the document.</p>

<p>T Vishnu Vardhan, programme director, Access to Knowledge, CIS, says the policy will have long-term impact. "A bulk of our higher education budget goes to a handful of institutions. This will help improve the quality of learning and teaching in a few years," says he.</p>

## Context and Background

This draft policy emerged during a period of global momentum for open access mandates from research funders. The Department of Biotechnology and Department of Science and Technology were moving to align Indian scientific publishing practices with international developments in scholarly communication, particularly following similar policies adopted by the US National Institutes of Health and European research councils.

The policy addressed a persistent issue in Indian higher education: unequal access to research literature. Most Indian universities lacked subscriptions to comprehensive journal databases, creating barriers for students and faculty outside a small number of elite institutions. By mandating deposit of publicly funded research in open repositories, the policy aimed to democratise access to scientific knowledge across the country's academic infrastructure.

The draft included enforcement mechanisms linking compliance to future grant eligibility and career advancement for government researchers. It applied retroactively to research funded from fiscal year 2012-13 onwards and required deposit within specified embargo periods after journal publication. The Centre for Internet and Society contributed to the policy's formulation, bringing expertise in access to knowledge issues and open licensing frameworks.

The final version of the policy was approved in December 2014, establishing formal requirements for institutional repositories at organisations receiving core funding from these departments. Implementation would face practical challenges around repository infrastructure, metadata standards and researcher compliance, though it represented a significant shift in India's approach to publicly funded scholarship.
