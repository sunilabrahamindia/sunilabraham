<p>NEW DELHI: The internet in India is freer now, but individuals could still get into trouble for online posts, say digital media and law experts. Hailing the Supreme Court judgment on Tuesday as a landmark verdict for free speech in India, experts who have closely read the judgment say there is much to be careful about too.</p>

<p>The scrapping of the contentious section doesn't mean that one has a free run, cautions Sunil Abraham, executive director, Centre for Internet and Society.</p>

<p>An online comment can still land you in jail, he says.</p>

<p>"The judgement in no way means that speech on online platforms will be unregulated now. You can still be charged for pornography or voyeurism under the IT Act. There are many provisions in the Constitution and Indian Penal Code that the government can use to target people it wants to go after. You can be still charged for hate speech or defamation – which is a criminal offence in India – for an online comment," says Abraham.</p>

<p>While lawyer Apar Gupta found the judgment to be forward-looking, he pointed to Para 98 of the 120 page judgment, which addresses Article 14 of the Constitution regarding "discrimination" and talks of the distinction between online and other media.</p>

<p>"We make it clear that there is an intelligible differentia between speech on the internet and other mediums of communication for which separate offences can certainly be created by legislation," says the judgment. "The court has indicated that special offences can be created for the internet. Constant vigilance is the price of liberty. We need to constantly engage with these issues to keep the internet free," says Gupta.</p>

<p>The judgment has been praised for making a distinction between online posts and messages that pertain to advocacy, discussion and incitement. "This is an excellent decision. The SC is saying that no matter what the medium, we stand for constitutional rights. The judges were ready to listen, and ready to share their experience of using the internet also," says Mishi Choudhary, legal director at Software Freedom Law Center, adding, "It was a lost opportunity for the Modi government. They should have gotten rid of section 66A themselves."</p>

<p>Section 69A of the Act, which stands as is, allows non-transparent blocking of online content in the interest of "sovereignty and integrity of India, defense of India, security of State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above." However, Choudhary says that since it is a narrowly-drawn provision, it ensures more safeguards.</p>

<p>"It will be noticed that Section 69A unlike Section 66A is a narrowly drawn provision with several safeguards. First and foremost, blocking can only be resorted to where the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary so to do. Secondly, such necessity is relatable only to some of the subjects set out in Article 19(2). Thirdly, reasons have to be recorded in writing in such blocking order so that they may be assailed in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution," she says.</p>

<p>Going forward, the government plan of action should focus on balancing safety and freedom on the internet, says Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar, who himself was one of the petitioners. "The final endgame has to be one where we have a new law or even a new IT Act which meets the twin objectives of a safe and free internet. The two need not be mutually exclusive," he says.</p>

## Context and Background

This article appeared six days after the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Shreya Singhal v Union of India, striking down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act as unconstitutional. The provision had criminalised sending messages through electronic communication that were deemed offensive, menacing or intended to cause annoyance or inconvenience, and had been widely used to prosecute individuals for social media posts critical of politicians or public figures.

The Court found Section 66A to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, failing to distinguish between legitimate discussion and advocacy versus speech that incites imminent lawless action. The judgment represented a significant victory for digital rights advocates who had challenged the provision on grounds that it violated Article 19(1)(a) guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression.

However, as legal experts noted, the striking down of Section 66A did not eliminate all legal risks associated with online expression. Other provisions in the Information Technology Act addressing obscenity, voyeurism and related offences remained in force. Additionally, numerous provisions in the Indian Penal Code covering defamation, hate speech and sedition could still be applied to digital communications. Section 69A of the IT Act, which permitted government blocking of online content on national security and public order grounds, also survived the judgment.

The Court's acknowledgement in paragraph 98 that internet-specific offences could be constitutionally permissible left open the possibility of future legislation targeting online speech. This created ongoing uncertainty about the boundaries of permissible regulation, requiring continued advocacy to ensure that any new provisions would meet constitutional standards for reasonable restrictions on free expression.
