<p>Most banks do not follow Reserve Bank of India's standard 64/128-bit encryption policy due to laxity and unavailability of funds.</p>

<hr class="article-separator">

<p><strong>Mumbai:</strong> A recent report by security software firm Sophos highlighted the increasing number of online attacks on Indian businesses, suggesting strong encryption policies can change the existing scenario.</p>

<p>As per a SophosLab research, India's threat exposure rate has been pegged at 16.7 per cent, ranking fifth in terms of highest percentage of endpoints exposed to malware attack.</p>

<p>The research said cyber-criminals have developed a keen sense of luring organisations on the basis of location, language and disguise, leading to an acute increase in the number of targeted attacks.</p>

<p>Global experts have explained that digital attackers have taken the aid of advanced malware including deadly ransomwares, which involve locking or capturing an organisation's valued data and demanding money to unlock it.</p>

<p>In future, ransomware have been predicted to become deadlier, allowing hackers to take control of an organisation's entire network security.</p>

<p>Not only financial and IT companies but Government websites also face similar obstructions due to lack of updated security tools.</p>

<p>Mohit Puri, Head of Pre-sales, Sophos India and SAARC, said, "India faces increased risk from cyber-criminals due to its high economic growth, which has left several companies to re-think their security strategy."</p>

<h3>Reactive to attacks, not proactive</h3>

<p>Though Puri mentioned that Indian enterprises have been trying to prevent such attacks, large fissures in network security have made the task easier for online criminals.</p>

<p>One of the major reasons for companies failing to prevent advanced cyber-attacks can be attributed to the lack of pragmatic solutions, albeit their awareness about the situation.</p>

<p>Puri said, "While companies are aware about security threats to our systems, we are still not there in terms of how we are trying to mitigate these threats."</p>

<p>According to Sunil Abraham, Director of The Centre For Internet and Society (CIS), there are manifold issues that have led to the scenario of India's poor online security.</p>

<p>He said that Indian businesses and financial organisations recognize the situation but do not want to allocate budget for updating their security infrastructure.</p>

<p>"The problem with cyber-security is just like smoking; people are aware of it but they do not care about the warnings. Companies know about the looming threats but need an episode to make a move towards updating their network infrastructure," Abraham added.</p>

<p>Enterprises also struggle due to the absence of sufficient cyber-security professionals in the country. Abraham said, "There are uncountable software professionals in India but the story is totally opposite when it boils down to cyber-security professionals."</p>

<h3>Weak encryption adoption</h3>

<p>According to technology enthusiast Blaise Crowly, Co-Founder & Head Of Security Design Gladius & Schild, Cryptography—a broader form of encryption can be defined as a branch of mathematical algorithms that can be used to securely protect data.</p>

<p>It is the one of the strongest form of all defence mechanisms against cyber attacks, Crowly added.</p>

<p>However, a Sophos assessment—State of Encryption Today—where 1,700 Indian IT managers were surveyed, showed the ignorance of companies towards integrating strong encryption tools.</p>

<p>Out of the total number of participants, only 61 per cent agreed that better encryption adoption can help companies in preventing proprietary data breaches.</p>

<p>However, others surveyed seemed reluctant on updating their security infrastructure or gave odd reasons. 18 per cent felt that encryption would help avoid incurring additional costs after a breach and 23 per cent just wanted to avoid negative publicity of the company.</p>

<p>Even in case of banks, reports suggested that most banks do not follow Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) standard 64/128 bit encryption policy due to laxity and unavailability of funds.</p>

<p>"Indian organisations need to take a second look at their security posture and deploy up-to-date synchronized security solutions that are able to combat today's threats as well as tomorrows," said Puri.</p>

<h3>Government's role</h3>

<p>A 2015 CIS study, titled "How India Regulates Encryption" mentioned that under section 84A of the IT Act, the government has the sole authority to prescribe modes and methods of encryption.</p>

<p>Though the government has not yet issued any rules in exercise of these powers, it had released earlier released a draft encryption policy on September 21, 2015. However, it failed to pass it due to wide-spread criticism regarding certain mandates in the draft.</p>

<p>In addition, the Internet Service Providers (ISP) License Agreement, between the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) and Internet Service Providers (ISP), limit the use of encryption up to 40-bit key length in symmetric algorithms—an extremely weak standard.</p>

<p>Although it cannot be enforced if organisations employ third-party encryption systems, it becomes extremely expensive for them. In such a scenario, companies hesitate in using better encryption standards.</p>

<p>CIS Director Sunil Abraham said, "To solve the issue, the government should work towards incentivising and enforcing strong security infrastructure which will help companies get these features at a lower price."</p>

<p>Adding to the aforementioned statement, Crowly highlighted that current security standards set by the government cannot adeptly counter advanced threats.</p>

<p>"OpenSSL, LibNaCl and similar protocols provide free implementation of encryption schemes that companies can use. The only issue is that companies and government agencies should show proper diligence in hiring experts in this field," Crowly concluded.</p>

## Context and Background

This report appeared during a period when ransomware was rapidly emerging as a dominant cyber threat globally. The WannaCry attack in May 2017 would soon demonstrate the devastating potential of ransomware at scale, but warning signs were already visible in 2016 as variants proliferated and attackers refined their techniques.

Sophos's research positioned India fifth globally in malware exposure rates, reflecting the country's rapid digital expansion without corresponding investment in security infrastructure. The 16.7 per cent threat exposure rate meant that nearly one in six Indian endpoints faced malware attacks—a troubling statistic for an economy increasingly dependent on digital services.

Abraham's smoking analogy captured a persistent challenge in cybersecurity: organisations acknowledged risks but deferred investment until crises forced action. This reactive rather than proactive approach left Indian enterprises perpetually vulnerable, scrambling to patch defences after breaches rather than preventing them systematically.

The Sophos survey revealing that only 61 per cent of Indian IT managers believed strong encryption prevented data breaches highlighted dangerous complacency. Nearly two-fifths either misunderstood encryption's protective value or prioritised other concerns—cost avoidance and reputation management—over fundamental security.

Banking sector non-compliance with RBI's 64/128-bit encryption standards was particularly alarming. Financial institutions handling sensitive customer data and conducting high-value transactions operated with inadequate cryptographic protections, whether due to technical laxity or budget constraints. This gap exposed customers to heightened risks of financial fraud and identity theft.

Regulatory failures compounded corporate shortcomings. The controversial draft encryption policy released in September 2015 had proposed requiring users to store plaintext copies of encrypted communications for 90 days and make them available to authorities—a measure that would have fundamentally undermined encryption's purpose. Following widespread backlash, the government withdrew the policy, but the episode revealed deep misunderstandings about cryptography amongst policymakers.

Meanwhile, outdated ISP licensing agreements limiting encryption to 40-bit key lengths—a standard considered obsolete since the 1990s—remained technically in force. Whilst unenforceable against organisations deploying third-party encryption, this regulatory anachronism created uncertainty and raised costs for compliance-conscious businesses.

Abraham's call for government incentivisation of strong security infrastructure recognised that market failures prevented adequate adoption. Small and medium enterprises lacked resources to implement robust cryptography, whilst regulatory ambiguity discouraged investment. Without policy interventions lowering barriers and mandating minimum standards, India's cybersecurity posture would remain dangerously weak.

The skills shortage Abraham identified—abundant software developers but scarce cybersecurity professionals—reflected systemic underinvestment in specialised training. As threats grew more sophisticated, this talent gap widened, leaving organisations unable to defend against adversaries whose capabilities continually evolved.
