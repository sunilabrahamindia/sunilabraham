<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> Parliament has passed legislation on Aadhaar that will give central agencies access to the world's biggest biometric database.</p>

<p><strong>Here's your 10-point guide to why this has become a political controversy:</strong></p>

      The Aadhaar database scheme, started seven years ago by the previous Congress-led government, was set up to streamline payment of benefits and cut down on massive wastage and fraud.

      Already, nearly a billion people have registered their finger prints and iris signatures. Opposition leaders and some critics say the privacy of a billion people could be compromised and agencies could misuse the data to profile and target individuals.

      The opposition had accused the government of using a loophole to bypass those objections. The proposal has been presented as a financial bill, which the Rajya Sabha cannot reject. It can only return the proposal to the Lok Sabha, which is an embarrassment for the government.

      So in the Rajya Sabha, opposition parties teamed up to ask for changes or revisions to the bill. Because the government is in a minority in the Upper House, the amendments were approved.

      But the Lok Sabha or Lower House, where the government has a powerful majority, rejected the changes.

      Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has defended the legislation in Parliament, saying Aadhaar saved the government an estimated $2.2 billion (around Rs.14,700 crore) in the last financial year.

## Context and Background

This cheatsheet condensed a contentious parliamentary moment when the Aadhaar Bill was pushed through as a money bill, limiting the Rajya Sabha's ability to block or reshape it. Opposition parties objected that this procedural choice sidestepped substantive debate about surveillance risks and the scope of state access to biometric data. The government, by contrast, framed Aadhaar primarily as an efficiency tool for subsidy delivery and fiscal savings.

The expert quotes underscored how far the legal framework lagged behind the technological capabilities of a nationwide biometric database. Concerns ranged from mission creep and mass surveillance to the absence of independent oversight comparable to safeguards in Europe or the United States. Sunil Abraham's "keys of every house in Delhi" analogy captured the structural vulnerability created when a single centralised system stores identifiers for nearly the entire population, raising questions that subsequent privacy and data protection debates in India have continued to confront.
