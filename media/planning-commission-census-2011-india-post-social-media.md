<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br>
For the Planning Commission, while the original idea was to drive traffic to its website, what eventually played out was an eye-opener.</p>

<p><strong>NEW DELHI:</strong> Even as the Centre is drawing up guidelines to encourage government bodies to use social media, a handful of entities are showing how they can use Facebook, Twitter and more to connect with citizens better.</p>

<p>The Planning Commission, Census 2011, department of posts, and the ministry of external affairs have, over the past year, established a functional and active presence on social media: from inviting suggestions to answering questions, from creating awareness to initiating debates. "It is inevitable because the government should go where the people are," says Sunil Abraham, executive director at the Centre for Internet and Society, a policy research organisation.</p>

<p>For the past six months, Gopi Kumar Bulusu, the CEO of Sankhya Technologies, an IT products company in Visakhapatnam, has been a regular contributor on the plan panel's Facebook page for the upcoming 12th Plan. "It gives you an opportunity to talk economics and contribute based on the knowledge you have," says Bulusu, a serial blogger. Arun Maira, member, Planning Commission, says its Facebook page, set up in February, works as a sounding board for ideas that emerge from offline consultations held by its 160 working groups. "The reach of Facebook is immense but the richness of communication is not much," says Maira. "It gives you a sense of the crowd but you don't expect great nuggets of advice." Yet, the Commission intends to make this engagement an ongoing one. "We want to create a new way of planning that's not episodic," says Maira.</p>

<p>The 12th Plan discussions were moved to a new page, managed by the CII's India@75 team, in early-August. Called 'Conversations with the Planning Commission', the posts are compiled and forwarded to the Commission from time to time, says Bhairavi Jani, executive director, India@75. "We plan to launch a dedicated YouTube channel and be on Twitter as well," she says. It's also getting Planning Commission members to participate in live Facebook discussions on specific topics. The reasons for being on social media platforms vary. It was at the suggestion of UN agencies working with the Census Department on its communication and website that the idea of a Facebook page came about to reach young citizens.</p>

<p>In its initial run, the page mostly received questions around the enumeration process. Now, as the results begin to trickle in, the number of 'likes' has touched 21,965 and the queries focus on the data -- on accessing it and reading it. The office of the Registrar General of India, which conducts the Census, puts out release dates of new data sets and their highlights, with links to its website. It also invites comments. "It's a two-way process and we are gaining as much as the others are," says a senior department official, not wanting to be identified.</p>

<p>The Department of Posts has been on Twitter for nearly two years. PN Ranjit Kumar, director global business of India Post, who handles the department's social media initiatives, explains that its Twitter presence started as a marketing tool to encourage people to visit their local post office more often. Along the way, there were some surprises. "The number of elders talking to us is huge," says Kumar. With 7,478 followers, it mostly gets suggestions on how to improve its service, and compliments and complaints.</p>

<p>Twitter was chosen for a reason, says Kumar. While Twitter, due to its 140-character limit, affords sharper comments, Facebook lends itself to broader and often unrelated conversations. "Facebook is informal and opens more flanks," he says. Twitter can also be used to take orders, handle customer grievances and become a customer relationship management tool, adds Kumar. And that's what India Post intends to do next. "We have plans to integrate this with our operations," he says. That's a challenge for organisations steeped in bureaucracy. "Relationship building is new to government organisations," says Kumar. "The point should be to be of use to the customer."</p>

<p>For the Planning Commission, while the original idea was to drive traffic to its website, what eventually played out was an eye-opener, says Harsh Shrivastava, consultant, Planning Commission, who manages its social media initiatives. "We are realising there's far greater expertise outside now," he says. "Facebook is like a huge opinion poll for us."</p>

<p>There are, however, concerns around aspects relating to privacy and data management. For instance, applying Right to Information (RTI) Act would mean archiving conversation records. "There need to be rules and regulations to govern usage of social media," says Abraham, who attended the first meeting convened by the department of information technology in March on social-media policy, and submitted recommendations.</p>

<p>For example, there are risks associated with unregulated public expression on social media sites. Referring to the Delhi Traffic Police account on Facebook, where citizens often post photographs of traffic violations, Abraham counters that these amount to a breach of privacy of the alleged violators. "Measures like blurring of licence plates could prevent crowd-sourcing of criminal investigations and vigilante action," he says. What's needed are SLAs (service level agreements), which create a tracking mechanism for response to posts on social media sites as well.</p>

<p>Many government departments participating on social media have so far assigned either a consultant or interns to operate the accounts. As the seriousness around this grows, and the potential is evident, they are considering deploying full-time resources or partnering with others.</p>

## Context and Background

This article captures the early phase of government adoption of social media in India, when public institutions were experimenting with new forms of civic engagement. Long before digital governance became mainstream, departments such as the Planning Commission, India Post and the Census Office were discovering both the opportunities and complexities of interacting with citizens online.

Sunil Abraham’s observations foreshadow later debates around digital governance: the need for privacy safeguards, policies on archiving, mechanisms to prevent misuse of images, and clear service level commitments for public engagement. The story shows how social media became an informal opinion-gathering tool for institutions, while simultaneously highlighting the risks of unregulated public expression and absence of structured policy frameworks.

The article stands as an important marker of India’s transition from static, top-down communication towards more interactive, participatory digital channels—revealing both the promise and the governance gaps that would shape future policy.
