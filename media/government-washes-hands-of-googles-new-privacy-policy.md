<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br>
The govt has more or less washed its hands of Google's new privacy policy that is being criticised in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>BANGALORE:</strong> The government has more or less washed its hands of internet giant Google's new privacy policy that is being criticised in Europe and elsewhere, but wants Indian residents to watch out for themselves.</p>

<p>Google's new privacy policy provides information on how personal information is collected, processed and secured, as required by relevant Indian laws. "The end users, however, need to fully understand the privacy policy of Google, the consequences of sharing their personal information and their privacy rights before they start using online services," Sachin Pilot, India's minister for information technology, stated in Rajya Sabha on March 30.</p>

<p>Ever since Google came out with a unified privacy policy in January, it has been facing criticism from many users and privacy advocates, especially in Europe where privacy is a fundamental right. The new policy unified separate privacy polices relating to nearly 60 of Google's services.</p>

<p>The new policy also lets the separate Google services, such as Gmail, Google Search or Youtube, share data among each other. In Europe, Google is facing potential sanctions or even fine over its new privacy policy.</p>

<p>Section 43A of the India's amended Information Technology Act (2000) has established a legal framework for data privacy protection in the country. The rules notified last year explain security practices to be followed and the need for guarding sensitive personal information. The Act also requires Indian corporations to publish a privacy policy.</p>

<p>"Google has published a Privacy Policy on their website," said the minister. "Any change in the privacy policy is not within the purview of amended Information Technology Act 2000," Pilot added. Venkatesh Hariharan (Venky), head of public policy and government affairs at Google India, has left the company last month and did not want to comment.</p>

<p>According to the Pilot, while France's independent privacy watchdog, the CNIL (nationale de l'informatique et des libertes) has said that the changes to Google's privacy policy do not comply with the European law, rectification of conflict between Google, an American company and European directive on data protection is not within the purview of the Indian government.</p>

<p>CNIL, the data protection watchdog in France had asked Google to answer 69 questions including what it does with the data collected from users and how long it is retained to better understand the consequences of the new policy for Google users.</p>

<p>Experts agree Google privacy policy is in compliance with Sec 43A of IT Act but cautioned that it may not be enough. "Section 43A does not have all the privacy safeguards that exist for citizen in developed countries," said Sunil Abraham, executive director at the Centre for Internet and Society.</p>

<p>Abraham advocates the creation of a privacy commissioner. "It is important to have a independent and autonomous regulator who can respond on a proactive basis when confronted with evidence of abusive practices," he said.</p>

<p>Legal provisions will have to enable the creation of such a regulator, says cyber law expert Vakul Sharma. "You can not create a regulator out of thin air. You should have legislation for privacy. In India we do not have any such legislation," said Sharma.</p>

<p>The IT act classifies information into two— personal information and sensitive personal information. Safeguards under the section 43A and rules apply to sensitive personal information which includes biometric information, information related to health, passwords, sexual orientation and financial information among others.</p>

<p>"Users must be aware that Google's new policy does not have room for categorization according to Indian laws," says Sharma. "It is a plain vanilla document. The users need more," he added.</p>

## Context and Background

Google's 2012 decision to merge dozens of service-specific privacy policies into a single document triggered widespread criticism, especially in Europe where data protection is treated as a fundamental right. The article highlights how India's legal framework at the time — centred on Section 43A of the IT Act — offered only basic safeguards and did not address many of the concerns raised by regulators abroad.

The government's position, as reflected in ministerial statements, was that users should take responsibility for understanding Google's policy. Experts quoted in the article, including Sunil Abraham, underscored the limitations of this approach: without a dedicated privacy authority or comprehensive legislation, users lacked meaningful protection or recourse. The debate anticipated later developments, including calls for a privacy commissioner and the push for a modern data protection law in India.
