<p>MUMBAI: As a young, prosperous IT entrepreneur from Bangalore, Sunil Abraham could well be a poster boy for India Shining.</p>

<p>But Mr Abraham is in Mumbai for a different kind of strategic alliance—this ostensible capitalist is flirting with peaceniks, feminists and human rights activists at the world's largest socialist gathering.</p>

<p>Mr Abraham's participation at the World Social Forum, which is being held in the city this week, is no passing dalliance.</p>

<p>He is a card holder of the free software movement in India which believes that software should not be proprietary but free for users to customise, share and distribute.</p>

<p>Mr Abraham boycotts Microsoft, like some anti-globalisation activists boycott Coke and Pepsi which, they claim, are symbols of all that is bad about international big business. "Globalisation is also about the privatisation of knowledge,'' he says, explaining the common ground he shares with, say, a Filipino fighting against the commercialisation of water supply in Manila.</p>

<p>Indeed, the average Mumbaikar who seeks to understand the anti-globalisation movement which has arrived in their midst in a flurry of song, dance and dust, will be hard put to define the nature of the beast.</p>

<p>For, despite the preponderance of socialists on the organising committee, the World Social Forum is no dogmatic lefty soapbox but a platform for an unwieldy range of social justice issues encompassing war and peace, caste and race, poverty and hunger, democracy and globalisation.</p>

<p>The forum embraces people as disparate as Vietnamese Bush-basher Mai Linh and Korean health activist Cheong Meong. Mr Cheong believes that multinationals are exploiting the poor of the Third World for First World profit.</p>

<p>Then there is Sampath Lal Bhil from Udaipur tehsil in Rajasthan, who is here to champion his land and forest rights, and Lukas Held, a German teenager, who says that to be apolitical is to "give up on the world''.</p>

<p>Organiser Gautam Mody calls this gathering "a rainbow coalition from centre left to that which believes in a socialist society, and everything in between''.</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour MP from Britain, suggests that the Forum is not defined by ideology so much as "opposition'', bringing together a huge and motley caravan of social movements, NGOs, activists and students.</p>

<p>Despite the diversity, some old comrades hope that the anti-globalisation movement betokens a resurgence of the left after two decades of unadulterated capitalism in the world.</p>

<p>And indeed, the exuberant sloganeering of the Forum might seem like a throwback to the heady middle decades of the 20th century, with its anti-colonial struggles, Nehruvian nation-building and flower power.</p>

<p>Other younger organisers agree. "Of course it is resurgent, only in a different form,'' says an organiser, who defines his peers as "freelance left''. "We are into causes rather than political parties, which are too dogmatic. We are into whatever is progressive.''</p>

## Context and Background

This article appeared during the World Social Forum held in Mumbai from 16 to 21 January 2004, which attracted between 75,000 and 100,000 participants from over 130 countries. The event marked the first time the annual gathering had been held outside Porto Alegre, Brazil, where it originated in 2001 as a counterpoint to the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The author's framing of Abraham as an "ostensible capitalist" reflected the tensions within debates about globalisation at the time. Free software advocates occupied an ambiguous position—they operated within capitalist economies and often ran successful businesses, yet challenged core assumptions about intellectual property that underpinned software industry business models. Abraham's characterisation of globalisation as involving "privatisation of knowledge" extended critiques beyond trade liberalisation and foreign direct investment to include the expansion of copyright, patent protection and proprietary technologies.

The Mumbai forum occurred during what came to be called the "India Shining" campaign period, a political slogan promoted by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government emphasising India's economic growth and technological advancement. The juxtaposition in the opening paragraph was deliberate—Abraham represented precisely the demographic the campaign celebrated, yet his presence at an explicitly anti-neoliberal gathering complicated the narrative.

Jeremy Corbyn's observation about the forum being defined by opposition rather than ideology captured a significant characteristic of early 21st century social movements. Unlike traditional left formations organised around class analysis and party structures, these newer networks coalesced around specific campaigns—against particular trade agreements, privatisation schemes or wars—without necessarily subscribing to comprehensive alternative economic systems. The term "freelance left" used by younger organisers reflected this shift towards issue-based activism that maintained scepticism towards both market fundamentalism and traditional socialist parties.

The forum took place against the backdrop of the Iraq War, which had begun in March 2003, and ongoing protests against neoliberal economic policies in various parts of the Global South. The diversity described in the article—from tribal land rights activists in Rajasthan to Korean health campaigners—illustrated the breadth of grievances that converged under the anti-globalisation banner, even as the movement struggled to articulate coherent alternatives to the systems it opposed.

Abraham's participation represented an attempt to position software freedom within this broader political context, arguing that Microsoft's dominance exemplified the same concentration of corporate power that activists challenged in other sectors. This framing would later inform his work at the Centre for Internet and Society, where questions of platform monopolies, data ownership and algorithmic governance would be understood not merely as technical concerns but as manifestations of deeper political-economic structures.
