<p>If you depend on just the <em>Times of India</em> or <em>Hindustan Times</em> for your daily news fix, chances are you have missed the story that has put Indian journalism under its fiercest gaze ever. For it turns out that a majority of Indian journalism censors news about its own indiscretions. After <em>Open</em> and <em>Outlook</em> magazine published transcripts of conversations between Niira Radia and high-profile journalists, much of the mainstream media erased the coverage about the controversy. Even the few papers and TV stations that covered the issue in the days to follow did not name names and avoided the meat of the story, hiding behind the sophistry of the transcripts being "unauthenticated".</p>

<p>Among the few that did, <em>The New Indian Express</em> and <em>Mail Today</em> (it did not name a former editor at the group though) picked up pieces of the conversations and the <em>Deccan Herald</em> carried an editorial on November 22. Among the vernacular papers, <em>Sakshi</em> and <em>Andhra Jyoti</em> in Andhra carried some excerpts. The Malayalam news channel Asianet picked up the story, but the English news channels were deafeningly quiet. CNN-IBN had a show on November 22 that claimed to "break the silence" but neither identified the people involved nor featured the transcripts; instead it pontificated on where to draw the line between lobbying and journalism. G. Sampath, deputy editor at <em>Daily News & Analysis</em>, Mumbai, wrote on his blog, "What is really scary is that, despite living in a 'democracy' that boasts of a 'free press', if you were dependent only on TV and the big newspapers for the biggest news developments of the day, you would never have known about the Niira Radia tapes, and the murky role of media as political power brokers."</p>

<p>Sevanti Ninan of <em>The Hoot</em>, an online media watch website, latched on to this "great media blackout". "The list of those who took no note is long and illustrious: <em>The Indian Express</em>, always quick off the mark on sensational disclosures. <em>The Hindu</em>, <em>The Times of India</em>, <em>Hindustan Times</em>, <em>India Today</em>, all those Hindi news channels," Sevanti wrote. "Not a story that three prominent journalists were trying to help a lobbyist get A. Raja a ministerial berth in the second UPA government." Filling the gap, the site has opened a forum to debate the ethical transgressions in the Radia tapes.</p>

<p>Despite its blackout in print, the story has largely survived because of the tremendous interest among India's netizens. The news was also carried prominently online in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>The Huffington Post</em>. Blogs are abuzz with indignant reactions to this censorship. The 'Radia Tapes Controversy' is now even a rapidly evolving and fairly detailed Wikipedia entry. YouTube throws up 35 matches for Radia and Barkha (Dutt), with one video (a transcript of one of the conversations) viewed close to 72,000 times. There are also numerous Facebook groups with discussions on how to "fix" the media. Google Barkha Dutt and the engine throws up Niira Radia as a prompt. And there's no dearth of tweets about "Barkhagate"—there are several every minute asking for these journalists to resign and some even call for them to be jailed. For some, especially among the Right, the controversy has come as a boon, lending credence to their argument that the "pseudo-secular" English media has sold its soul.</p>

<p>Finally, when the <em>ToI</em> reported online on November 25 about how the internet had kept the story alive, there were bursts of self-congratulatory messages and tweets exchanged online. For Sunil Abraham, executive director, Centre for Internet and Society, the Radia tapes controversy illustrates the "tension and disconnect" that exists between the internet and traditional media. "This is unlike on 26/11 when there was a kind of synergy between the two in their coverage," he says. Yet Net users deserve some credit for having made the debate interactive and infusing it with a much-needed spunk and pluralism. "For me, the most exciting thing about the 'Barkhagate' controversy is not the internet's influence on the attention economy," adds Abraham. "It's actually been its crowd-sourcing ability to bring together the intelligence of many amateurs from across the world and to put their insights into one collective analysis of the controversy." While the Net, with just about 20 million users, is yet to rival the traditional media's hold on India, the latter undoubtedly have a force it must now reckon with.</p>

## Context and Background

This article documented a significant episode in Indian media coverage during November 2010, following the publication of transcripts from the Niira Radia tapes. Recorded during tax investigations, the conversations involved a corporate lobbyist and senior journalists, politicians, and business figures, touching on cabinet formation and telecom policy.

When *Open* and *Outlook* published portions of the transcripts, much of India's mainstream English-language media avoided detailed reporting on the issue. Several journalists named in the conversations were employed by major news organisations, making the absence of coverage particularly notable. Reporting that did occur often avoided naming individuals or engaging directly with the substance of the transcripts.

The article highlights how television news channels and leading newspapers largely maintained silence, with limited coverage framing the issue as a debate about lobbying rather than examining the contents of the tapes. Media critics and observers questioned whether this reflected an unwillingness within the profession to scrutinise its own conduct.

In contrast, online platforms sustained attention on the controversy. Blogs, social media, international news outlets, and collaborative online resources continued to circulate transcripts and commentary, ensuring the issue remained visible despite limited domestic broadcast and print coverage.

The piece also points to emerging forms of networked analysis, where dispersed individuals collectively examined documents, tracked media responses, and documented omissions. This activity did not replace traditional journalism but exposed gaps in editorial coverage and highlighted differences between institutional media practices and internet-enabled public discussion.

By placing these dynamics side by side, the article captures tensions between traditional gatekeeping roles in Indian media and the growing capacity of online platforms to challenge editorial silences during moments of media accountability.
