### AI Safety Summit (2023)
The United Kingdom initiated this diplomatic sequence on 1–2 November 2023 with the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit, where 28 nations signed the Bletchley Declaration, prioritising frontier AI risks and establishing initial safety frameworks. This was the first ever global summit on artificial intelligence. 

### AI Seoul Summit (2024)
The momentum shifted to South Korea six months later for the AI Seoul Summit, held on 21 – 24 May 2024. This second chapter proved pivotal, resulting in the Seoul Declaration, which successfully brought major AI laboratories and civil society advocates to the negotiating table alongside heads of state. 

### AI Action Summit (2025) 
France hosted the AI Action Summit on 10 – 11 February 2025. By that time, the global narrative had fundamentally matured. The conversation moved beyond the abstract, safety-first anxieties of earlier meetings toward a more pragmatic focus on "AI for Action"—emphasising tangible implementation, measurable socio-economic outcomes, and the scaling of technology for the public good.

### India's Hosting and Positioning (2026)
India's decision to host the 2026 summit marks an effort to shape the direction of the ongoing international AI dialogue rather than merely extend it. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Delhi gathering during the Paris summit, explicitly framing it as an opportunity to centre the perspectives and priorities of emerging and developing economies in AI policy debates. This positioning reflects India's growing ambitions as both an AI developer and a voice for nations navigating the technology divide between well-resourced and resource-constrained countries. The summit title itself signals this broader intent: whilst earlier gatherings emphasised 'safety' or 'action', India's choice of 'impact' underscores a focus on tangible applications, equitable access and developmental outcomes.

India's engagement with artificial intelligence has accelerated substantially in recent years through coordinated policy initiatives and institutional development. The IndiaAI Mission, launched as a comprehensive national programme, established the organisational infrastructure and strategic vision underlying the summit. This mission encompasses multiple pillars, including the development of sovereign computing capacity, creation of public AI datasets, support for innovation ecosystems and programmes to democratise AI access across Indian society. The government has simultaneously worked to position the country as a responsible AI innovator through frameworks balancing technological advancement with ethical guardrails and inclusive design principles.

### Global Regulatory Landscape

The summit takes place amid divergent regulatory and governance approaches to artificial intelligence. The European Union has adopted a comprehensive, risk-based legislative framework through the EU AI Act. The United States has emphasised executive guidance, voluntary commitments and public-private collaboration. China has combined state-directed AI advancement with regulatory controls over algorithmic deployment and content governance.

Within this varied international landscape, India has sought to articulate an approach that integrates innovation, developmental priorities and governance safeguards. The India summit reflects an effort to engage with existing global frameworks while also foregrounding the concerns of countries building digital infrastructure, expanding compute capacity and addressing labour-market transitions linked to automation. In this sense, the gathering forms part of a broader discussion about how global AI governance can incorporate perspectives from emerging economies alongside those of established industrial powers.

### Visual Identity

The official logo of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 was unveiled on 18 September 2025 following a nationwide design contest hosted on MyGov, which received 599 entries from across India. The winning design, created by Shri Ajith P. Suresh, incorporates several symbolic elements reflecting the summit's vision.

<div class="visual-identity-logo">
  <img src="/events/images/ai-impact-summit-2026-logo.png" alt="India AI Impact Summit 2026 Logo">
</div>

The logo features the Ashoka Chakra at its centre, representing India's constitutional values and commitment to ethical governance in artificial intelligence development. Radiating outward from the central wheel are neural network-inspired flares rendered in a vibrant gradient palette, symbolising AI's transformative potential and the diversity of perspectives that artificial intelligence systems must incorporate. The bilingual presentation, featuring both English and Hindi text, emphasises India's multilingual approach to inclusive technology development.

## Objectives and Core Pillars

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 articulates its objectives through a structured framework designed to translate high-level AI governance discussions into implementable policy and development outcomes. The summit's conceptual architecture is organised around two complementary frameworks: the Three Sutras, which define its guiding principles, and the Seven Chakras, which structure its thematic working tracks.

### The Three Sutras

The summit is anchored in three guiding principles, termed 'Sutras', a Sanskrit word denoting essential threads that bind wisdom to action. These principles articulate India's vision for how artificial intelligence development should proceed at the international level.

**People**: This principle centres AI development on serving humanity across its full diversity, respecting cultural identities whilst preserving human dignity. The focus encompasses human-centred development in an AI-enabled world, advancing inclusivity through multilingual and culturally contextualised systems, and establishing robust frameworks for safe and trusted AI deployment. The People sutra emphasises that technological progress must prioritise human welfare, social empowerment and the protection of individual rights throughout the AI development lifecycle.

**Planet**: This sutra addresses the dual challenge of making AI infrastructure more resource-efficient whilst simultaneously leveraging AI capabilities to accelerate climate resilience and environmental protection. It acknowledges that AI systems carry significant computational and energy costs, requiring sustainable approaches to model development and deployment. Simultaneously, the Planet principle recognises AI's potential to advance scientific breakthroughs in understanding and managing biological systems, provided that technological advancement aligns with planetary stewardship rather than environmental degradation.

**Progress**: This principle advocates for equitable distribution of AI benefits, ensuring that technological advances contribute to broad-based development rather than concentrating advantages amongst wealthy nations or elite institutions. The Progress sutra frames AI as a tool for inclusive economic growth, particularly targeting opportunities for small businesses and developing economies that risk being marginalised in the global technology race. It reflects the summit's stated objective of reducing barriers to participation in AI development and deployment, particularly for countries facing resource and infrastructure constraints.

### The Seven Chakras

Building upon the three foundational Sutras, the summit operationalises its agenda through seven thematic working groups, termed 'Chakras'. Each Chakra addresses a distinct dimension of AI's global impact, translating aspirational principles into concrete areas for multilateral collaboration and policy action. These working groups form the organisational backbone for the summit's discussions, panels and outcome documents.

**Human Capital**: Focuses on preparing the global workforce for an AI-integrated economy through equitable reskilling programmes and human development initiatives. This Chakra addresses labour market transitions and the need for educational systems to adapt to rapidly evolving technological demands.

**Inclusion for Social Empowerment**: Advances inclusive-by-design AI development that accounts for linguistic diversity, gender equity, accessibility requirements and the needs of underserved communities. This working group examines how AI systems can be engineered to serve diverse populations rather than replicating existing inequalities.

**Safe and Trusted AI**: Establishes frameworks for transparency, accountability and shared safeguards to foster public confidence in AI systems. This Chakra addresses data governance, ethical deployment standards and mechanisms for ensuring AI systems operate in line with human values.

**Science**: Harnesses artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and fosters international research collaboration across disciplines. This working group explores how AI can enhance scientific discovery whilst ensuring that research benefits are shared globally rather than concentrated in well-resourced institutions.

**Resilience, Innovation and Efficiency**: Develops resource-efficient and climate-conscious AI models tailored for varied economic environments. This Chakra examines how nations with limited computational resources can nonetheless participate in AI innovation through optimised architectures and collaborative development approaches.

**Democratising AI Resources**: Ensures affordable access to foundational enablers including compute power, datasets and models, aiming to bridge the digital divide between resource-rich and resource-constrained countries. This working group addresses infrastructure gaps that prevent many nations from developing or deploying AI systems

**AI for Economic Development and Social Good**: Scales AI applications in vital sectors including healthcare, agriculture and education, with particular emphasis on developing-world contexts. This Chakra focuses on translating AI capabilities into measurable improvements in human welfare and economic opportunity.

Together, the Sutras and Chakras provide a cohesive framework intended to move international AI discussions from aspirational declarations towards measurable outcomes and concrete policy implementation. Through these structures, India aims to shape global AI norms whilst simultaneously addressing challenges specific to economies at different stages of technological capacity.

## Outcome Documents

The India AI Impact Summit represents the latest milestone in a rapidly evolving international dialogue on artificial intelligence governance. Understanding this summit's policy significance requires examining the declarations, statements and commitments that have emerged from preceding gatherings, as these texts collectively trace the development of global consensus—and divergence—on how AI should be governed, deployed and regulated.

### AI Safety Summit (Bletchley Park, November 2023)

#### The Bletchley Declaration

The United Kingdom convened the world's first dedicated AI safety summit at Bletchley Park on 1–2 November 2023, producing the **Bletchley Declaration**—a foundational text signed by 28 countries and the European Union. The declaration marked the first time governments collectively acknowledged that frontier AI systems pose "potentially catastrophic" risks requiring urgent international cooperation. Signatories committed to developing shared understandings of AI opportunities and risks, prioritising transparency in AI development, and establishing frameworks for identifying and mitigating severe threats posed by advanced AI systems.

The declaration's significance lies not merely in its risk-focused language but in securing participation from nations with divergent geopolitical interests, including the United States, China, and members of the European Union. By establishing AI safety as a legitimate domain for international diplomatic engagement, Bletchley set the precedent for subsequent summits to expand beyond narrow technical safety concerns toward broader questions of equity, sustainability and governance.

### AI Seoul Summit (South Korea, May 2024)

The AI Seoul Summit, held on 21–22 May 2024, built upon Bletchley's foundation whilst broadening the agenda to encompass innovation and inclusion alongside safety. South Korea's hosting marked a deliberate effort to position Asia as a central actor in AI governance discussions and to foreground questions of digital equity that had received limited attention in earlier safety-focused deliberations.

#### Seoul Declaration for Safe, Innovative and Inclusive AI

The **Seoul Declaration**, signed by 11 countries and entities during the Leaders' Session on 21 May 2024, explicitly linked safety frameworks to innovation policy and inclusive development. The declaration recognised that rigid safety requirements risk concentrating AI capabilities amongst well-resourced actors, potentially widening rather than narrowing global technological divides. Signatories committed to fostering international cooperation that balances rigorous safety standards with support for innovation ecosystems, particularly in countries lacking advanced AI infrastructure.

</div>

#### Frontier AI Safety Commitments

Running parallel to governmental declarations, the Seoul Summit secured voluntary commitments from 20 leading AI companies—including Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. The **Frontier AI Safety Commitments** obligate signatories to define thresholds for intolerable risk, conduct rigorous pre-deployment testing, implement robust security controls for unreleased model weights, and maintain transparency regarding their safety frameworks.

These commitments represent the first instance of major AI laboratories publicly pledging to specific accountability measures, including commitments not to deploy models if risks cannot be adequately mitigated. The voluntary nature of these pledges, however, raises questions about enforceability and whether industry self-regulation can substitute for binding regulatory frameworks.

### AI Action Summit (Paris, February 2025)

France hosted the **AI Action Summit** on 10–11 February 2025, marking a decisive shift from the risk-oriented discourse of Bletchley toward implementation, sustainability, and equitable access. Co-chaired by France and India, the Paris gathering explicitly centred the priorities of emerging and developing economies, reflecting frustration amongst Global South nations that earlier summits had focused disproportionately on risks posed by cutting-edge systems whilst neglecting questions of access, capacity-building, and the environmental costs of AI infrastructure.

#### Statement on Inclusive and Sustainable Artificial Intelligence for People and the Planet

The **Paris Statement**, signed by a broad coalition of countries, established concrete initiatives addressing digital divides, AI's environmental impact, and labour market transitions. Notably, the United States and United Kingdom abstained from signing, signalling divergence between nations prioritising open, publicly funded AI development and those emphasising private-sector-led innovation protected by intellectual property regimes.

The statement committed signatories to launching a Public Interest AI Platform and Incubator, establishing an observatory on AI's energy consumption in partnership with the International Energy Agency, and creating a network of observatories monitoring AI's impact on labour markets. This represented the first multilateral commitment to governance mechanisms addressing AI's socio-economic and environmental externalities, not merely its technical safety.

### India AI Impact Summit (February 2026)

The **India AI Impact Summit**, scheduled for 16–20 February 2026 in New Delhi, positions itself as the next phase in this diplomatic progression. Organised under India's IndiaAI Mission, the summit aims to translate the aspirational commitments of previous declarations into concrete policy frameworks and implementation strategies.

#### Leaders' Declaration (Forthcoming)

The summit's primary outcome document, the **Leaders' Declaration**, will be formally adopted on 20 February 2026. Based on pre-summit consultations and the framework of the Three Sutras (People, Planet, Progress) and Seven Chakras (thematic working groups), the declaration is expected to address mechanisms for democratising access to AI compute, datasets, and foundational models; frameworks for AI deployment in healthcare, agriculture, and education tailored to developing-country contexts; standards for human capital development and workforce reskilling in AI-integrated economies; and governance structures ensuring AI systems respect linguistic diversity, gender equity, and accessibility.

### Policy Evolution: From Bletchley to Delhi

Examining these outcome documents collectively reveals a clear trajectory in international AI governance discourse. Bletchley established safety as a legitimate international concern. Seoul expanded the agenda to encompass innovation and inclusion, recognising that safety-first approaches risk entrenching existing power asymmetries. Paris pivoted decisively toward implementation, sustainability, and equity, with the notable absence of the US and UK signalling fractures in the consensus forged at Bletchley.

India's summit seeks to consolidate these themes whilst centring the perspectives and priorities of emerging economies. The shift from abstract commitments to concrete mechanisms—observatories, platforms, capacity-building initiatives—reflects maturation in the governance conversation. Yet the voluntary, non-binding nature of these declarations, combined with divergent national interests and regulatory approaches, leaves open the question of whether this diplomatic process can produce enforceable norms capable of shaping how AI is actually developed and deployed.

The outcome documents from Delhi will provide the clearest indication yet of whether international AI governance can move beyond declarations toward coordinated action.


## Programme and Activities

The India AI Impact Summit spans five days, from 16 to 20 February 2026, combining exhibition activities, bilateral engagements and high-level plenary sessions. The programme is structured to balance formal diplomatic proceedings with practical showcases of AI applications and innovation ecosystems.

### Pre-Summit Engagement

The India AI Impact Summit was preceded by an extensive engagement programme designed to build momentum and ensure broad participation across India's regions and sectors. The organisational framework solicited over 1,300 proposals for pre-summit events, from which organisers approved and facilitated more than 480 activities held across the country prior to the main gathering. These distributed events provided platforms for regional stakeholders, academic institutions, industry associations and civil society groups to contribute perspectives that would inform the summit's agenda.

The pre-summit programme included seven flagship events addressing specific dimensions of AI policy and application. Through this preparatory phase, organisers engaged approximately 301,000 participants, establishing a foundation for the summit's discussions by surfacing priorities, challenges and opportunities identified by diverse constituencies. This distributed engagement model reflected the summit's emphasis on inclusive consultation and sought to ensure that the Delhi proceedings incorporated insights extending beyond India's metropolitan centres and established technology hubs.

### Summit Structure

The event is organised across two main components: the AI Impact Expo, which runs throughout the five-day period (16–20 February), and the Summit Sessions, concentrated on 19–20 February. This structure allows participants to engage with both technological demonstrations and policy discussions, whilst providing space for bilateral meetings and networking amongst delegates.

The exhibition component occupies 70,000 square metres at Bharat Mandapam, showcasing AI applications, breakthrough technologies and innovation from participating countries. The expo provides a platform for demonstrating real-world AI implementations across sectors including healthcare, agriculture, education and public infrastructure.

The core diplomatic proceedings take place over two days, featuring plenary sessions with heads of state, thematic panel discussions organised around the Seven Chakras, and working group deliberations. These sessions are expected to produce policy commitments, collaborative frameworks and the Leaders' Declaration.

### Call for Proposals

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 invited organisations worldwide to host events included in the official summit programme, conducted in person at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, from 16–20 February 2026. The call encouraged organisations to design sessions aligning with the summit's themes, fostering diverse participation and generating actionable insights or outcomes strengthening global dialogue on AI for people, planet and progress.

The application window closed on 30 November 2025, receiving over 700 proposals. Shortlisted candidates are contacted via their registered email addresses. Organisations playing a meaningful role in shaping the summit's deliberations include government agencies, academic and research institutions, multilateral and intergovernmental organisations, private sector organisations, non-profits, think tanks, civil society organisations, and industry or professional associations. Joint proposals between multiple stakeholders, especially across countries or sectors, were particularly encouraged.

Eligible event formats included panel discussions, roundtables, workshops, fireside chats and moderated dialogues, leadership talks and industry forums, and academic presentations and other talks. Fully virtual sessions were not considered for inclusion in the official summit programme. All events were required to demonstrate clear alignment with the summit's seven core themes or Chakras: Human Capital; Inclusion for Social Empowerment; Safe and Trusted AI; Resilience, Innovation and Efficiency; Science; Democratising AI Resources; and AI for Economic Growth and Social Good. Each applicant could submit only one proposal for consideration in one theme.

The call for proposals launched on 15 October 2025, with the submission deadline set for 30 November 2025. By hosting events at the summit, organisations contribute to shaping deliberations and driving outcomes that advance impactful and globally relevant discourse on AI.
