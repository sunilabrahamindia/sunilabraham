</div>

### AI Safety Summit (2023)
The United Kingdom initiated this diplomatic sequence on 1–2 November 2023 with the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit, where 28 nations signed the Bletchley Declaration, prioritising frontier AI risks and establishing initial safety frameworks. This was the first ever global summit on artificial intelligence. 

### AI Seoul Summit (2024)
The momentum shifted to South Korea six months later for the AI Seoul Summit, held on 21 – 22 May 2024. This second chapter proved pivotal, resulting in the Seoul Declaration, which successfully brought major AI laboratories and civil society advocates to the negotiating table alongside heads of state. 

### AI Action Summit (2025) 
France hosted the AI Action Summit on 10 – 11 February 2025. By that time, the global narrative had fundamentally matured. The conversation moved beyond the abstract, safety-first anxieties of earlier meetings toward a more pragmatic focus on "AI for Action"—emphasising tangible implementation, measurable socio-economic outcomes, and the scaling of technology for the public good.

### India's Hosting and Positioning (2026)
India's decision to host the 2026 summit marks an effort to shape the direction of the ongoing international AI dialogue rather than merely extend it. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Delhi gathering during the Paris summit, explicitly framing it as an opportunity to centre the perspectives and priorities of emerging and developing economies in AI policy debates. This positioning reflects India's growing ambitions as both an AI developer and a voice for nations navigating the technology divide between well-resourced and resource-constrained countries. The summit title itself signals this broader intent: whilst earlier gatherings emphasised 'safety' or 'action', India's choice of 'impact' underscores a focus on tangible applications, equitable access and developmental outcomes.

India's engagement with artificial intelligence has accelerated substantially in recent years through coordinated policy initiatives and institutional development. The IndiaAI Mission, launched as a comprehensive national programme, established the organisational infrastructure and strategic vision underlying the summit. This mission encompasses multiple pillars, including the development of sovereign computing capacity, creation of public AI datasets, support for innovation ecosystems and programmes to democratise AI access across Indian society. The government has simultaneously worked to position the country as a responsible AI innovator through frameworks balancing technological advancement with ethical guardrails and inclusive design principles.

### Global Regulatory Landscape

The summit takes place amid divergent regulatory and governance approaches to artificial intelligence. The European Union has adopted a comprehensive, risk-based legislative framework through the EU AI Act. The United States has emphasised executive guidance, voluntary commitments and public-private collaboration. China has combined state-directed AI advancement with regulatory controls over algorithmic deployment and content governance.

Within this varied international landscape, India has sought to articulate an approach that integrates innovation, developmental priorities and governance safeguards. The India summit reflects an effort to engage with existing global frameworks while also foregrounding the concerns of countries building digital infrastructure, expanding compute capacity and addressing labour-market transitions linked to automation. In this sense, the gathering forms part of a broader discussion about how global AI governance can incorporate perspectives from emerging economies alongside those of established industrial powers.

## Outcome Documents

<p>The India AI Impact Summit represents the latest milestone in a rapidly evolving international dialogue on artificial intelligence governance. Understanding this summit's policy significance requires examining the declarations, statements and commitments that have emerged from preceding gatherings, as these texts collectively trace the development of global consensus—and divergence—on how AI should be governed, deployed and regulated.</p>

<h3>AI Seoul Summit (South Korea, May 2024)</h3>

<p>The AI Seoul Summit, held on 21–22 May 2024, built upon Bletchley's foundation whilst broadening the agenda to encompass innovation and inclusion alongside safety. South Korea's hosting marked a deliberate effort to position Asia as a central actor in AI governance discussions and to foreground questions of digital equity that had received limited attention in earlier safety-focused deliberations.</p>

<h4>Seoul Declaration for Safe, Innovative and Inclusive AI</h4>

<p>The Seoul Declaration, signed by 11 countries and entities during the Leaders' Session on 21 May 2024, explicitly linked safety frameworks to innovation policy and inclusive development. The declaration recognised that rigid safety requirements risk concentrating AI capabilities amongst well-resourced actors, potentially widening rather than narrowing global technological divides. Signatories committed to fostering international cooperation that balances rigorous safety standards with support for innovation ecosystems, particularly in countries lacking advanced AI infrastructure.</p>

<h4>Frontier AI Safety Commitments</h4>

<p>Running parallel to governmental declarations, the Seoul Summit secured voluntary commitments from 20 leading AI companies—including Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. The Frontier AI Safety Commitments obligate signatories to define thresholds for intolerable risk, conduct rigorous pre-deployment testing, implement robust security controls for unreleased model weights, and maintain transparency regarding their safety frameworks.</p>

<p>These commitments represent the first instance of major AI laboratories publicly pledging to specific accountability measures, including commitments not to deploy models if risks cannot be adequately mitigated. The voluntary nature of these pledges, however, raises questions about enforceability and whether industry self-regulation can substitute for binding regulatory frameworks.</p>

<h3>Policy Evolution: From Bletchley to Delhi</h3>

<p>Examining these outcome documents collectively reveals a clear trajectory in international AI governance discourse. Bletchley established safety as a legitimate international concern. Seoul expanded the agenda to encompass innovation and inclusion, recognising that safety-first approaches risk entrenching existing power asymmetries. Paris pivoted decisively toward implementation, sustainability, and equity, with the notable absence of the US and UK signalling fractures in the consensus forged at Bletchley.</p>

<p>India's summit seeks to consolidate these themes whilst centring the perspectives and priorities of emerging economies. The shift from abstract commitments to concrete mechanisms—observatories, platforms, capacity-building initiatives—reflects maturation in the governance conversation. Yet the voluntary, non-binding nature of these declarations, combined with divergent national interests and regulatory approaches, leaves open the question of whether this diplomatic process can produce enforceable norms capable of shaping how AI is actually developed and deployed.</p>

<p>The outcome documents from Delhi will provide the clearest indication yet of whether international AI governance can move beyond declarations toward coordinated action.</p>

## Policy Evolution: Quantitative Analysis

A comparative analysis of outcome documents from the 2023–2025 AI summit sequence reveals a dramatic reorientation in international AI governance priorities.

### From Safety to Openness

Keyword frequency analysis across seven major outcome documents demonstrates a fundamental policy shift:

| Era | Documents | Safety+Safe | Open* | Ratio |
|-----|-----------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **Bletchley (2023)** | Chair's Statement, Safety Testing | 44 | 2 | 22:1 |
| **Seoul (2024)** | Declaration, Safety Science, Commitments | 42 | 1 | 42:1 |
| **Paris/India (2025)** | Paris Statement, India-France Declaration | 9 | 10 | 0.9:1 |

*Includes: open, openness, open-source, open standards, open data

The Bletchley Declaration (November 2023) mentioned "safety" or "safe" 44 times across its primary documents whilst referencing "open" concepts only twice—specifically framing open-source models as potential risks requiring additional safety measures. By contrast, the Paris Statement and India-France Declaration (February 2025) reversed this emphasis, with "open" references (10) exceeding safety language (9) for the first time in AI summit history.

### Regulatory Vision Shift

This quantitative shift reflects changing diplomatic priorities:

**Bletchley Park (2023):** Frontier AI characterised as posing "potentially catastrophic" risks. Open-source development treated as a safety concern. International cooperation centred on risk mitigation and safety testing protocols.

**Seoul (2024):** Maintained safety focus (42 safety references) whilst introducing "innovation" and "inclusion" as co-equal goals. However, openness rhetoric remained absent—only a single reference to "openness, transparency, and reciprocity" in scientific cooperation contexts.

**Paris (2025):** First explicit embrace of "open AI models" language. Safety references dropped 88% from Seoul levels. The statement committed signatories to "focusing on open AI models" and launching a Public Interest AI Platform supporting "openness and transparency."

**India-France (2025):** Marked the clearest articulation of an openness agenda, advocating "development of free and open resources for all countries," "broad and open and freely reusable large language models," and explicit support for "open source tools." Notably, the United States and United Kingdom declined to sign the Paris Statement, signalling divergence between nations prioritising open, publicly funded AI development and those emphasising private-sector innovation protected by intellectual property regimes.

### India 2026: Implications

India's positioning as co-chair of the Paris Summit and signatory to the openness-centred India-France Declaration suggests the Delhi gathering may continue this trajectory. The summit's "Democratising AI Resources" working group—one of its Seven Chakras—potentially operationalises openness as a counterweight to concentrated AI capabilities amongst Western firms. Whether India's 2026 outcome documents sustain, moderate, or reverse the 2025 pivot toward openness will clarify whether this shift represents a durable realignment or a transient diplomatic moment.

## Programme and Activities

The India AI Impact Summit spans five days, from 16 to 20 February 2026, combining exhibition activities, bilateral engagements and high-level plenary sessions. The programme is structured to balance formal diplomatic proceedings with practical showcases of AI applications and innovation ecosystems.

### Pre-Summit Engagement

The India AI Impact Summit was preceded by an extensive engagement programme designed to build momentum and ensure broad participation across India's regions and sectors. The organisational framework solicited over 1,300 proposals for pre-summit events, from which organisers approved and facilitated more than 480 activities held across the country prior to the main gathering. These distributed events provided platforms for regional stakeholders, academic institutions, industry associations and civil society groups to contribute perspectives that would inform the summit's agenda.

The pre-summit programme included seven flagship events addressing specific dimensions of AI policy and application. Through this preparatory phase, organisers engaged approximately 301,000 participants, establishing a foundation for the summit's discussions by surfacing priorities, challenges and opportunities identified by diverse constituencies. This distributed engagement model reflected the summit's emphasis on inclusive consultation and sought to ensure that the Delhi proceedings incorporated insights extending beyond India's metropolitan centres and established technology hubs.

### Summit Structure

The event is organised across two main components: the AI Impact Expo, which runs throughout the five-day period (16–20 February), and the Summit Sessions, concentrated on 19–20 February. This structure allows participants to engage with both technological demonstrations and policy discussions, whilst providing space for bilateral meetings and networking amongst delegates.

The exhibition component occupies 70,000 square metres at Bharat Mandapam, showcasing AI applications, breakthrough technologies and innovation from participating countries. The expo provides a platform for demonstrating real-world AI implementations across sectors including healthcare, agriculture, education and public infrastructure.

The core diplomatic proceedings take place over two days, featuring plenary sessions with heads of state, thematic panel discussions organised around the Seven Chakras, and working group deliberations. These sessions are expected to produce policy commitments, collaborative frameworks and the Leaders' Declaration.

### Call for Proposals

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 invited organisations worldwide to host events included in the official summit programme, conducted in person at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, from 16–20 February 2026. The call encouraged organisations to design sessions aligning with the summit's themes, fostering diverse participation and generating actionable insights or outcomes strengthening global dialogue on AI for people, planet and progress.

The application window closed on 30 November 2025, receiving over 700 proposals. Shortlisted candidates are contacted via their registered email addresses. Organisations playing a meaningful role in shaping the summit's deliberations include government agencies, academic and research institutions, multilateral and intergovernmental organisations, private sector organisations, non-profits, think tanks, civil society organisations, and industry or professional associations. Joint proposals between multiple stakeholders, especially across countries or sectors, were particularly encouraged.

Eligible event formats included panel discussions, roundtables, workshops, fireside chats and moderated dialogues, leadership talks and industry forums, and academic presentations and other talks. Fully virtual sessions were not considered for inclusion in the official summit programme. All events were required to demonstrate clear alignment with the summit's seven core themes or Chakras: Human Capital; Inclusion for Social Empowerment; Safe and Trusted AI; Resilience, Innovation and Efficiency; Science; Democratising AI Resources; and AI for Economic Growth and Social Good. Each applicant could submit only one proposal for consideration in one theme.

        <strong>Bletchley (2023):</strong> 22:1 safety-to-openness ratio<br>
        <strong>Seoul (2024):</strong> 42:1 safety-to-openness ratio<br>
