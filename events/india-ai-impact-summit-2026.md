### AI Safety Summit (2023)
The United Kingdom initiated this diplomatic sequence on 1–2 November 2023 with the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit, where 28 nations signed the Bletchley Declaration, prioritising frontier AI risks and establishing initial safety frameworks. This was the first ever global summit on artificial intelligence. 

### AI Seoul Summit (2024)
The momentum shifted to South Korea six months later for the AI Seoul Summit, held on 21 – 22 May 2024. This second chapter proved pivotal, resulting in the Seoul Declaration, which successfully brought major AI laboratories and civil society advocates to the negotiating table alongside heads of state. 

### AI Action Summit (2025) 
France hosted the AI Action Summit on 10 – 11 February 2025. By that time, the global narrative had fundamentally matured. The conversation moved beyond the abstract, safety-first anxieties of earlier meetings toward a more pragmatic focus on "AI for Action"—emphasising tangible implementation, measurable socio-economic outcomes, and the scaling of technology for the public good.

### India's Hosting and Positioning (2026)
India's decision to host the 2026 summit marked an effort to shape the direction of the ongoing international AI dialogue rather than merely extend it. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Delhi gathering during the Paris summit, explicitly framing it as an opportunity to centre the perspectives and priorities of emerging and developing economies in AI policy debates. This positioning reflected India's growing ambitions as both an AI developer and a voice for nations navigating the technology divide between well-resourced and resource-constrained countries. The summit title itself signalled this broader intent: whilst earlier gatherings emphasised 'safety' or 'action', India's choice of 'impact' underscores a focus on tangible applications, equitable access and developmental outcomes.

India's engagement with artificial intelligence has accelerated substantially in recent years through coordinated policy initiatives and institutional development. The IndiaAI Mission, launched as a comprehensive national programme, established the organisational infrastructure and strategic vision underlying the summit. This mission encompasses multiple pillars, including the development of sovereign computing capacity, creation of public AI datasets, support for innovation ecosystems and programmes to democratise AI access across Indian society. The government has simultaneously worked to position the country as a responsible AI innovator through frameworks balancing technological advancement with ethical guardrails and inclusive design principles.

### Global Regulatory Landscape

The summit took place amid divergent regulatory and governance approaches to artificial intelligence. The European Union has adopted a comprehensive, risk-based legislative framework through the EU AI Act. The United States has emphasised executive guidance, voluntary commitments and public-private collaboration. China has combined state-directed AI advancement with regulatory controls over algorithmic deployment and content governance.

Within this varied international landscape, India has sought to articulate an approach that integrates innovation, developmental priorities and governance safeguards. The India summit reflects an effort to engage with existing global frameworks while also foregrounding the concerns of countries building digital infrastructure, expanding compute capacity and addressing labour-market transitions linked to automation. In this sense, the gathering forms part of a broader discussion about how global AI governance can incorporate perspectives from emerging economies alongside those of established industrial powers.

## Outcome Documents

<p>The India AI Impact Summit represented the latest milestone in a rapidly evolving international dialogue on artificial intelligence governance. Understanding this summit's policy significance requires examining the declarations, statements and commitments that have emerged from preceding gatherings, as these texts collectively trace the development of global consensus—and divergence—on how AI should be governed, deployed and regulated.</p>

<h3>AI Seoul Summit (South Korea, May 2024)</h3>

<p>The AI Seoul Summit, held on 21–22 May 2024, built upon Bletchley's foundation whilst broadening the agenda to encompass innovation and inclusion alongside safety. South Korea's hosting marked a deliberate effort to position Asia as a central actor in AI governance discussions and to foreground questions of digital equity that had received limited attention in earlier safety-focused deliberations.</p>

<h4>Seoul Declaration for Safe, Innovative and Inclusive AI</h4>

<p>The Seoul Declaration, signed by 11 countries and entities during the Leaders' Session on 21 May 2024, explicitly linked safety frameworks to innovation policy and inclusive development. The declaration recognised that rigid safety requirements risk concentrating AI capabilities amongst well-resourced actors, potentially widening rather than narrowing global technological divides. Signatories committed to fostering international cooperation that balances rigorous safety standards with support for innovation ecosystems, particularly in countries lacking advanced AI infrastructure.</p>

<h4>Frontier AI Safety Commitments</h4>

<p>Running parallel to governmental declarations, the Seoul Summit secured voluntary commitments from 20 leading AI companies—including Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. The Frontier AI Safety Commitments obligate signatories to define thresholds for intolerable risk, conduct rigorous pre-deployment testing, implement robust security controls for unreleased model weights, and maintain transparency regarding their safety frameworks.</p>

<p>These commitments represent the first instance of major AI laboratories publicly pledging to specific accountability measures, including commitments not to deploy models if risks cannot be adequately mitigated. The voluntary nature of these pledges, however, raises questions about enforceability and whether industry self-regulation can substitute for binding regulatory frameworks.</p>

<h3>Policy Evolution: From Bletchley to Delhi</h3>

<p>Examining these outcome documents collectively revealed a clear trajectory in international AI governance discourse. Bletchley established safety as a legitimate international concern. Seoul expanded the agenda to encompass innovation and inclusion, recognising that safety-first approaches risk entrenching existing power asymmetries. Paris pivoted decisively toward implementation, sustainability, and equity, with the notable absence of the US and UK signalling fractures in the consensus forged at Bletchley.</p>

<p>India's summit sought to consolidate these themes whilst centring the perspectives and priorities of emerging economies. The shift from abstract commitments to concrete mechanisms—observatories, platforms, capacity-building initiatives—reflected maturation in the governance conversation. Yet the voluntary, non-binding nature of these declarations, combined with divergent national interests and regulatory approaches, leaves open the question of whether this diplomatic process can produce enforceable norms capable of shaping how AI is actually developed and deployed.</p>

<p>The outcome documents from Delhi provided the clearest indication yet of whether international AI governance can move beyond declarations toward coordinated action.</p>

## Policy Evolution: Quantitative Analysis

A comparative analysis of outcome documents from the 2023–2025 AI summit sequence revealed a dramatic reorientation in international AI governance priorities.

<div class="tsap-info-box">
<strong>Methodological note:</strong> While we link to all textual outputs of the India Summit in the <a href="#outcome-documents">Outcome Documents</a> section, the numerical analysis for 2026 is strictly reserved for the apex Leaders' Declaration. This ensures an accurate, apples-to-apples comparison with the primary outcome declarations of previous global summits.

### From Safety to Inclusive Governance

Keyword frequency analysis across major outcome documents demonstrates a fundamental policy shift, expanding well beyond a strict safety paradigm into broader socioeconomic domains:

<strong>Search parameters & Methodology:</strong> Keyword counts were generated using programmatic, case-insensitive text extraction across the primary Leaders' Declarations for each summit (Bletchley 2023, Seoul 2024, Paris 2025). Exact-match string searches were used. No semantic expansion, synonym clustering, stemming, or contextual interpretation was applied.

"Open*" includes open, openness, open-source, open standards and open data. Counts reflect literal occurrences within the official declaration texts only.

Source PDFs are linked above. The full CSV dataset is available for independent verification and replication.
</div>

This quantitative shift reflected changing diplomatic priorities. The Bletchley Declaration (November 2023) maintained an overwhelming focus on safety, risk, and frontier models. By contrast, subsequent summits began diversifying language. Paris fundamentally reversed the initial safety emphasis, with "sustainable" frameworks (9) and "inclusive" references (7) superseding strict risk mitigation (1) and effectively matching safety language (6) for the first time in AI summit history.

### Regulatory Vision Shift

This quantitative shift reflected changing diplomatic priorities:

**Bletchley Park (2023):** Frontier AI characterised as posing "potentially catastrophic" risks. Open-source development treated as a safety concern. International cooperation centred on risk mitigation and safety testing protocols.

**Seoul (2024):** Maintained safety focus (**38** safety references) whilst introducing "innovation" and "inclusion" as co-equal goals. However, openness rhetoric remained scarce across core declarations, with a **5.43:1** safety-to-openness ratio.

**Paris (2025):** First explicit embrace of "open AI models" language. Safety references dropped 84.2% from Seoul levels. The statement committed signatories to "focusing on open AI models" and launching a Public Interest AI Platform supporting "openness and transparency."

**India-France (2025):** Marked the clearest articulation of an openness agenda, advocating "development of free and open resources for all countries," "broad and open and freely reusable large language models," and explicit support for "open source tools." Notably, the United States and United Kingdom declined to sign the Paris Statement, signalling divergence between nations prioritising open, publicly funded AI development and those emphasising private-sector innovation protected by intellectual property regimes.

### India 2026: Implications

India's positioning as co-chair of the Paris Summit and signatory to the openness-centred India-France Declaration carried this trajectory into Delhi. The summit's "Democratising AI Resources" working group—one of its Seven Chakras — operationalises openness as a counterweight to concentrated AI capabilities amongst Western firms. The Delhi Declaration's explicit embrace of open AI resources and democratic diffusion suggested this shift represents a durable realignment rather than a transient diplomatic moment.

## Normative Shift in Global AI Governance

Beyond terminology and institutional mechanisms, the summit sequence from 2023 to 2025 reflects a deeper normative transformation in how artificial intelligence is conceptualised within international policy discourse.

The 2023 Bletchley framework was grounded in precaution. Frontier AI systems were framed primarily through the lens of catastrophic and systemic risk, with governance structured around containment, safety testing and institutional oversight. The dominant policy logic was risk mitigation.

By 2024, Seoul introduced a balancing narrative. Safety remained central, but innovation and inclusion were explicitly elevated as co-equal objectives. This marked the beginning of a shift from pure precaution toward calibrated enablement.

Paris in 2025 represented a further evolution. The framing pivoted toward implementation, sustainability and development equity. Openness was recast not as a vulnerability, but as a tool for democratisation. Institutional proposals moved from safety institutes toward shared platforms, observatories and public-interest infrastructure.

The India–France articulation sharpened this trajectory by explicitly advocating resource democratisation, open and reusable models, and development-oriented AI cooperation. The centre of gravity moved from catastrophic frontier risk to distributive access and economic enablement.

This progression suggested that international AI governance is transitioning from a security-dominated paradigm toward a development-oriented governance model—one that prioritises access, infrastructure and capacity-building alongside safety considerations.

## Key Attendees

The India AI Impact Summit attracted participation from over 100 countries, with delegations including 15–20 heads of government, more than 50 ministers, over 50 chief executives from leading global and Indian companies, and approximately 500 prominent figures from the international AI ecosystem. These included innovators, researchers, chief technology officers and representatives from multilateral organisations. The scale of participation reflected the summit's positioning as a major diplomatic and policy forum addressing artificial intelligence governance and development.

The summit organisers published a list of key attendees on the official website, focusing primarily on chief executives, senior leadership and prominent global figures. This curated selection highlights individuals holding executive positions or recognised leadership roles within their respective organisations and sectors.
