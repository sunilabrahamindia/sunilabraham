</div>

### AI Safety Summit (2023)
The United Kingdom initiated this diplomatic sequence on 1–2 November 2023 with the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit, where 28 nations signed the Bletchley Declaration, prioritising frontier AI risks and establishing initial safety frameworks. This was the first ever global summit on artificial intelligence. 

### AI Seoul Summit (2024)
The momentum shifted to South Korea six months later for the AI Seoul Summit, held on 21 – 24 May 2024. This second chapter proved pivotal, resulting in the Seoul Declaration, which successfully brought major AI laboratories and civil society advocates to the negotiating table alongside heads of state. 

### AI Action Summit (2025) 
France hosted the AI Action Summit on 10 – 11 February 2025. By that time, the global narrative had fundamentally matured. The conversation moved beyond the abstract, safety-first anxieties of earlier meetings toward a more pragmatic focus on "AI for Action"—emphasising tangible implementation, measurable socio-economic outcomes, and the scaling of technology for the public good.

### India's Hosting and Positioning (2026)
India's decision to host the 2026 summit marks an effort to shape the direction of the ongoing international AI dialogue rather than merely extend it. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Delhi gathering during the Paris summit, explicitly framing it as an opportunity to centre the perspectives and priorities of emerging and developing economies in AI policy debates. This positioning reflects India's growing ambitions as both an AI developer and a voice for nations navigating the technology divide between well-resourced and resource-constrained countries. The summit title itself signals this broader intent: whilst earlier gatherings emphasised 'safety' or 'action', India's choice of 'impact' underscores a focus on tangible applications, equitable access and developmental outcomes.

India's engagement with artificial intelligence has accelerated substantially in recent years through coordinated policy initiatives and institutional development. The IndiaAI Mission, launched as a comprehensive national programme, established the organisational infrastructure and strategic vision underlying the summit. This mission encompasses multiple pillars, including the development of sovereign computing capacity, creation of public AI datasets, support for innovation ecosystems and programmes to democratise AI access across Indian society. The government has simultaneously worked to position the country as a responsible AI innovator through frameworks balancing technological advancement with ethical guardrails and inclusive design principles.

### Global Regulatory Landscape

The summit takes place amid divergent regulatory and governance approaches to artificial intelligence. The European Union has adopted a comprehensive, risk-based legislative framework through the EU AI Act. The United States has emphasised executive guidance, voluntary commitments and public-private collaboration. China has combined state-directed AI advancement with regulatory controls over algorithmic deployment and content governance.

Within this varied international landscape, India has sought to articulate an approach that integrates innovation, developmental priorities and governance safeguards. The India summit reflects an effort to engage with existing global frameworks while also foregrounding the concerns of countries building digital infrastructure, expanding compute capacity and addressing labour-market transitions linked to automation. In this sense, the gathering forms part of a broader discussion about how global AI governance can incorporate perspectives from emerging economies alongside those of established industrial powers.

## Objectives and Core Pillars

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 articulates its objectives through a structured framework designed to translate high-level AI governance discussions into implementable policy and development outcomes. The summit's conceptual architecture is organised around two complementary frameworks: the Three Sutras, which define its guiding principles, and the Seven Chakras, which structure its thematic working tracks.

### The Three Sutras

The summit is anchored in three guiding principles, termed 'Sutras', a Sanskrit word denoting essential threads that bind wisdom to action. These principles articulate India's vision for how artificial intelligence development should proceed at the international level.

**People**: This principle centres AI development on serving humanity across its full diversity, respecting cultural identities whilst preserving human dignity. The focus encompasses human-centred development in an AI-enabled world, advancing inclusivity through multilingual and culturally contextualised systems, and establishing robust frameworks for safe and trusted AI deployment. The People sutra emphasises that technological progress must prioritise human welfare, social empowerment and the protection of individual rights throughout the AI development lifecycle.

**Planet**: This sutra addresses the dual challenge of making AI infrastructure more resource-efficient whilst simultaneously leveraging AI capabilities to accelerate climate resilience and environmental protection. It acknowledges that AI systems carry significant computational and energy costs, requiring sustainable approaches to model development and deployment. Simultaneously, the Planet principle recognises AI's potential to advance scientific breakthroughs in understanding and managing biological systems, provided that technological advancement aligns with planetary stewardship rather than environmental degradation.

**Progress**: This principle advocates for equitable distribution of AI benefits, ensuring that technological advances contribute to broad-based development rather than concentrating advantages amongst wealthy nations or elite institutions. The Progress sutra frames AI as a tool for inclusive economic growth, particularly targeting opportunities for small businesses and developing economies that risk being marginalised in the global technology race. It reflects the summit's stated objective of reducing barriers to participation in AI development and deployment, particularly for countries facing resource and infrastructure constraints.

### The Seven Chakras

Building upon the three foundational Sutras, the summit operationalises its agenda through seven thematic working groups, termed 'Chakras'. Each Chakra addresses a distinct dimension of AI's global impact, translating aspirational principles into concrete areas for multilateral collaboration and policy action. These working groups form the organisational backbone for the summit's discussions, panels and outcome documents.

**Human Capital**: Focuses on preparing the global workforce for an AI-integrated economy through equitable reskilling programmes and human development initiatives. This Chakra addresses labour market transitions and the need for educational systems to adapt to rapidly evolving technological demands.

**Inclusion for Social Empowerment**: Advances inclusive-by-design AI development that accounts for linguistic diversity, gender equity, accessibility requirements and the needs of underserved communities. This working group examines how AI systems can be engineered to serve diverse populations rather than replicating existing inequalities.

**Safe and Trusted AI**: Establishes frameworks for transparency, accountability and shared safeguards to foster public confidence in AI systems. This Chakra addresses data governance, ethical deployment standards and mechanisms for ensuring AI systems operate in line with human values.

**Science**: Harnesses artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and fosters international research collaboration across disciplines. This working group explores how AI can enhance scientific discovery whilst ensuring that research benefits are shared globally rather than concentrated in well-resourced institutions.

**Resilience, Innovation and Efficiency**: Develops resource-efficient and climate-conscious AI models tailored for varied economic environments. This Chakra examines how nations with limited computational resources can nonetheless participate in AI innovation through optimised architectures and collaborative development approaches.

**Democratising AI Resources**: Ensures affordable access to foundational enablers including compute power, datasets and models, aiming to bridge the digital divide between resource-rich and resource-constrained countries. This working group addresses infrastructure gaps that prevent many nations from developing or deploying AI systems

**AI for Economic Development and Social Good**: Scales AI applications in vital sectors including healthcare, agriculture and education, with particular emphasis on developing-world contexts. This Chakra focuses on translating AI capabilities into measurable improvements in human welfare and economic opportunity.

Together, the Sutras and Chakras provide a cohesive framework intended to move international AI discussions from aspirational declarations towards measurable outcomes and concrete policy implementation. Through these structures, India aims to shape global AI norms whilst simultaneously addressing challenges specific to economies at different stages of technological capacity.

## Programme and Activities

The India AI Impact Summit spans five days, from 16 to 20 February 2026, combining exhibition activities, bilateral engagements and high-level plenary sessions. The programme is structured to balance formal diplomatic proceedings with practical showcases of AI applications and innovation ecosystems.

### Summit Structure

The event is organised across two main components: the AI Impact Expo, which runs throughout the five-day period (16–20 February), and the Summit Sessions, concentrated on 19–20 February. This structure allows participants to engage with both technological demonstrations and policy discussions, whilst providing space for bilateral meetings and networking amongst delegates.

The exhibition component occupies 50,000 square metres at Bharat Mandapam, showcasing AI applications, breakthrough technologies and innovation from participating countries.
