**Infosys Investor AI Day 2026** is an investor-focused event held on 17 February 2026. Infosys Board Chairman Nandan Nilekani delivers the keynote presentation "Tech Transitions: Why is the AI Transition Different?", examining how AI represents a fundamental shift requiring comprehensive organisational change across technology, business, talent, operating models and mental frameworks.

## Nandan Nilekani Keynote Themes

### Historical Context of Technology Transitions

Nilekani's presentation positions AI within a timeline of major technology milestones spanning six centuries. The printing press (1400s) enabled physical, static information distribution. Electrification and telegraph (1900s) maintained this paradigm. Transistors (1960s) initiated the shift to digital, dynamic operations, continuing through personal computers, internet, mobile devices and cloud computing (1960–2025). Generative AI and agentic AI (2025 onwards) represent the current phase. Global GDP grew from $500 billion (1400s) to $500 trillion (2025) across these transitions, according to data cited from Coatue.

Enterprise technology transitions progressed through computerisation (mainframe, minicomputer, PC replacing paper workflows), internet access (client-server, LAN, web computing enabling globalisation and platform business models) and cloud access (mobile, enterprise apps, big data providing digital scalability and modular architectures). Each phase redefined enterprise operations and IT infrastructure.

### AI Adoption Velocity

AI reached one billion users in under five years, faster than smartphones (approximately 10 years) or the internet (15–20 years). The presentation characterises this as the fastest technology innovation to achieve this milestone, based on public data sources.

### Five Dimensions of AI Transformation

Nilekani argues AI is not an additional technology layer or adjacency but requires simultaneous transformation across five dimensions:

1. **Technology**: AI-ready systems, AI-enabled data platforms, AI-native architecture
2. **Business**: Integrated business functions with AI at core, AI-embedded workflows  
3. **Talent**: Scalable AI-augmented workforce, adaptive learning and change management
4. **Operating Model**: Cross-functional knowledge graphs, exponential engineering
5. **Mental Model**: Evidence-first principles, responsible AI frameworks

The presentation states: "AI transformation is not a lift and shift; it requires a fundamental root and branch surgery."

### Legacy System Modernisation Urgency

The presentation emphasises that accumulated technical debt over decades must be addressed. Key statistics from US Government Accountability Office and Adalo research include:

- 60–80% of IT budgets spent on outdated systems
- Average breach detection exceeds 200 days in legacy environments  
- Legacy systems operate on data silos, causing innovation paralysis

Demand-side challenges (low agility, slow rate of change, technical debt, security costs) contrast with supply-side advantages of modern systems (high rate of change, efficiency, enhanced security and compliance, easy scalability). The presentation concludes modernisation can no longer be deferred.

### Build vs Buy Dynamics

As AI becomes core enterprise infrastructure, the balance shifts towards building proprietary solutions. Approximately 50% of firms maintain dedicated AI budgets as of 2025, with AI representing 23% of IT spend, according to Foundry's AI Priorities study 2025. The presentation notes enterprises prefer proprietary agentic layers atop foundational models, moving from standardised purchased software towards customisable, composable solutions to avoid vendor lock-in whilst maintaining internal control.

### AI Innovation Acceleration

Innovation cycles have compressed significantly. Leaderboards change constantly, driven by substantial investment increases from $24 billion (2023) to $140 billion estimated (2025), based on data from GitHub, S&P Global and Medium. Foundational models evolved from 100 billion-plus parameters and 10–12 agent frameworks (2023) to one trillion-plus parameters and 60-plus agent frameworks (2025). The presentation lists major models including GPT-4, Gemini, Claude 2, Mistral-medium (2023) and Llama 4, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Deepseek R1, Mistral-3, Gemma 3, Grok 4.1, Kimi 2 Thinking, GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Hiku 4.5 (2025).

### Deployment Gap

Benchmark model performance advances faster than realised enterprise value, creating a widening deployment gap. The presentation, citing Snorkel research, shows foundational technology has progressed through deep learning and frontier models whilst enterprise value capture lags significantly. AI progress outpaces enterprise readiness.

### Workforce Transformation

Talent demand pivots from legacy roles to high-growth AI skills. World Economic Forum data cited in the presentation projects 92 million traditional jobs face displacement, including front-end web developers, QA testers, IT support specialists and blockchain developers. Simultaneously, 170 million new jobs emerge: data annotators, AI forensic analysts, AI leads, AI engineers and forward-deployed engineers.

### Greenfield vs Brownfield Productivity

New-build environments achieve 15–50% task-level productivity gains with AI due to clean structure, consistent patterns, real-time data availability and structured environments suited to probabilistic AI systems. Legacy (brownfield) environments face technical debt, data silos, undocumented dependencies and deterministic architectures, resulting in high overhead and rework. Only 1% of brownfield functions have scaled AI to business-function level, according to McKinsey and International Center for Law & Economics research. The presentation emphasises organisational productivity differs from task-level productivity.

### Implementation Risks

AI's zero marginal cost of generation creates risks including "AI slops" (low-quality automated content), illusion of productivity without genuine value and organisational atrophy if high-skilled expertise erodes. The presentation recommends structured usage guidelines, clear quality gates, explainability and traceability, measuring value capture rather than usage volume, and empowering high-skilled workforces. "AI investments are meaningful only if they lead to major productivity gains."

### Enduring Principles

Despite rapid change, eight principles remain essential: first-principles thinking, understanding enterprise context, agnostic design, getting the house in order (data governance), leadership in effective change, strong collaboration, intense focus on productivity, and engineering bent of mind.
