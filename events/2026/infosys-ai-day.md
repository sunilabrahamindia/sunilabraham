**Infosys Investor AI Day 2026** is an investor-focused event held on 17 February 2026. Infosys Board Chairman Nandan Nilekani delivers the keynote presentation "Tech Transitions: Why is the AI Transition Different?", examining how AI represents a fundamental shift requiring comprehensive organisational change across technology, business, talent, operating models and mental frameworks.

## Nandan Nilekani Keynote Themes

### Historical Context of Technology Transitions

Nilekani's presentation positions AI within a timeline of major technology milestones spanning six centuries. The printing press (1400s) enabled physical, static information distribution. Electrification and telegraph (1900s) maintained this paradigm. Transistors (1960s) initiated the shift to digital, dynamic operations, continuing through personal computers, internet, mobile devices and cloud computing (1960–2025). Generative AI and agentic AI (2025 onwards) represent the current phase. Global GDP grew from $500 billion (1400s) to $500 trillion (2025) across these transitions, according to data cited from Coatue.

Enterprise technology transitions progressed through computerisation (mainframe, minicomputer, PC replacing paper workflows), internet access (client-server, LAN, web computing enabling globalisation and platform business models) and cloud access (mobile, enterprise apps, big data providing digital scalability and modular architectures). Each phase redefined enterprise operations and IT infrastructure.

### Event Format and Live Coverage

Infosys streamed the event live, featuring multiple presentations from senior leadership. CEO Salil Parekh presented "The AI Services Opportunity", whilst Chief Delivery Officers Satish H.C. and Dinesh Rao delivered the "AI Services Playbook" session. The programme included sector-specific case studies demonstrating AI deployment across telecommunications, banking, retail and energy sectors.

### AI Adoption Velocity

AI reached one billion users in under five years, faster than smartphones (approximately 10 years) or the internet (15–20 years). The presentation characterises this as the fastest technology innovation to achieve this milestone, based on public data sources.

### Five Dimensions of AI Transformation

Nilekani argues AI is not an additional technology layer or adjacency but requires simultaneous transformation across five dimensions:

1. **Technology**: AI-ready systems, AI-enabled data platforms, AI-native architecture
2. **Business**: Integrated business functions with AI at core, AI-embedded workflows  
3. **Talent**: Scalable AI-augmented workforce, adaptive learning and change management
4. **Operating Model**: Cross-functional knowledge graphs, exponential engineering
5. **Mental Model**: Evidence-first principles, responsible AI frameworks

The presentation states: "AI transformation is not a lift and shift; it requires a fundamental root and branch surgery."

### Legacy System Modernisation Urgency

The presentation emphasises that accumulated technical debt over decades must be addressed. Key statistics from US Government Accountability Office and Adalo research include:

- 60–80% of IT budgets spent on outdated systems
- Average breach detection exceeds 200 days in legacy environments  
- Legacy systems operate on data silos, causing innovation paralysis

Demand-side challenges (low agility, slow rate of change, technical debt, security costs) contrast with supply-side advantages of modern systems (high rate of change, efficiency, enhanced security and compliance, easy scalability). The presentation concludes modernisation can no longer be deferred.

### Build vs Buy Dynamics

As AI becomes core enterprise infrastructure, the balance shifts towards building proprietary solutions. Approximately 50% of firms maintain dedicated AI budgets as of 2025, with AI representing 23% of IT spend, according to Foundry's AI Priorities study 2025. The presentation notes enterprises prefer proprietary agentic layers atop foundational models, moving from standardised purchased software towards customisable, composable solutions to avoid vendor lock-in whilst maintaining internal control.

### AI Innovation Acceleration

Innovation cycles have compressed significantly. Leaderboards change constantly, driven by substantial investment increases from $24 billion (2023) to $140 billion estimated (2025), based on data from GitHub, S&P Global and Medium. Foundational models evolved from 100 billion-plus parameters and 10–12 agent frameworks (2023) to one trillion-plus parameters and 60-plus agent frameworks (2025). The presentation lists major models including GPT-4, Gemini, Claude 2, Mistral-medium (2023) and Llama 4, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Deepseek R1, Mistral-3, Gemma 3, Grok 4.1, Kimi 2 Thinking, GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Hiku 4.5 (2025).

### Deployment Gap

Benchmark model performance advances faster than realised enterprise value, creating a widening deployment gap. The presentation, citing Snorkel research, shows foundational technology has progressed through deep learning and frontier models whilst enterprise value capture lags significantly. AI progress outpaces enterprise readiness.

### Workforce Transformation

Talent demand pivots from legacy roles to high-growth AI skills. World Economic Forum data cited in the presentation projects 92 million traditional jobs face displacement, including front-end web developers, QA testers, IT support specialists and blockchain developers. Simultaneously, 170 million new jobs emerge: data annotators, AI forensic analysts, AI leads, AI engineers and forward-deployed engineers.

### Greenfield vs Brownfield Productivity

New-build environments achieve 15–50% task-level productivity gains with AI due to clean structure, consistent patterns, real-time data availability and structured environments suited to probabilistic AI systems. Legacy (brownfield) environments face technical debt, data silos, undocumented dependencies and deterministic architectures, resulting in high overhead and rework. Only 1% of brownfield functions have scaled AI to business-function level, according to McKinsey and International Center for Law & Economics research. The presentation emphasises organisational productivity differs from task-level productivity.

### Implementation Risks

AI's zero marginal cost of generation creates risks including "AI slops" (low-quality automated content), illusion of productivity without genuine value and organisational atrophy if high-skilled expertise erodes. The presentation recommends structured usage guidelines, clear quality gates, explainability and traceability, measuring value capture rather than usage volume, and empowering high-skilled workforces. "AI investments are meaningful only if they lead to major productivity gains."

### Enduring Principles

Despite rapid change, eight principles remain essential: first-principles thinking, understanding enterprise context, agnostic design, getting the house in order (data governance), leadership in effective change, strong collaboration, intense focus on productivity, and engineering bent of mind.

## CEO Salil Parekh on AI Services Strategy

### AI Revenue Disclosure

Parekh revealed that AI services accounted for 5.5% of Infosys revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025–26, marking the company's first public breakdown of AI business contribution. With total quarterly revenue of ₹45,479 crore, AI services generated approximately ₹2,501 crore during the period. Parekh characterised AI growth as "robust" and "extremely dynamic", noting the company operates 4,600 active AI projects and has developed over 500 AI agents.

### Six AI Service Value Pools

Parekh outlined six emerging AI-led service opportunities Infosys targets for growth:

1. **AI Strategy and Engineering**: Helping enterprises design and implement AI-native architectures
2. **Data for AI**: Building structured data infrastructure to enable AI scaling
3. **Process AI**: Embedding AI into business workflows and operational systems
4. **Agentic Legacy Modernisation**: Deploying autonomous agents to replace or augment legacy systems
5. **Physical AI**: Integrating AI with hardware, industrial devices and physical infrastructure
6. **AI Trust**: Establishing governance frameworks, explainability and responsible AI practices

Parekh projected these service categories could create a $400 billion market opportunity by 2030. He noted Infosys already delivers AI services to 90% of its top 200 clients.

### Talent Transformation

The company recruited over 20,000 college graduates whilst simultaneously reskilling existing workforce for AI-first delivery models. Parekh emphasised Infosys's shift towards a "Human+ AI" operational approach, combining human expertise with AI augmentation rather than wholesale automation.

## Chief Delivery Officers on AI Implementation

### Multi-Layer Transformation Approach

Satish H.C. and Dinesh Rao, both Chief Delivery Officers, presented Infosys's execution playbook for enterprise AI adoption. They argued successful implementation requires simultaneous transformation across AI strategy, data architecture, trust frameworks and domain-specific applications rather than isolated pilot projects.

### Data Challenges

Rao highlighted that unstructured data remains a primary obstacle to AI scaling. "Data can accelerate or decelerate AI scaling. One of the key challenges today is that data is not structured," he stated, positioning data governance as prerequisite infrastructure for effective AI deployment.

### Infosys Topaz Platform

Chief Technology Officer Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar presented Infosys Topaz, the company's enterprise AI fabric platform designed to provide standardised "AI runways" for consistent deployment across client environments. The platform aims to reduce implementation friction and enable faster scaling of AI capabilities.

### Physical AI Focus

Rao emphasised "Physical AI"—AI systems integrated with hardware, sensors and industrial equipment—as an accelerating growth area. Infosys's offerings include physical AI strategy consulting, AI-first product design and digital twin development for manufacturing and infrastructure clients.

### Case Study: Multinational Food Company

Satish H.C. showcased a multi-year AI transformation for an unnamed multinational food products firm, demonstrating phased rollout from late 2023 through early 2026. The project illustrated Infosys's methodology for transitioning from pilot AI projects to enterprise-wide deployment.

## Sector-Specific AI Applications
