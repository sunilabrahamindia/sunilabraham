### Session A: Democratising AI Resources

The session explored business-driven AI, India's digital public infrastructure, startup innovation and cloud transformation as drivers of inclusive social impact. Speakers discussed how scalable AI enabled SMEs and startups to expand services and opportunities, and how India shared cross-border AI collaborations for regional growth.

### Session B: India's AI Leadership as a Catalyst for Regional Social Transformation

**Official title**: Inclusion for Social Empowerment (4:30–5:30 PM)

Sunil Abraham moderated this session on replicating India's digital infrastructure, enterprise AI and startup ecosystems across South Asia. The discussion examined how frugal AI solutions functioned on basic phones, in local languages and across low-bandwidth networks, and how they contributed to financial inclusion, healthcare access, skills development, rural employment and broader empowerment for 1.4 billion people.

**Panel**:  
- Aditya Swamy (Google)  
- Akhil Choudhary (Highspring India)  
- Prof. M. P. Gupta (IIM Lucknow)  

Anne Robinson (IBM) was listed in the pre-event programme but did not appear during the session.

Sunil Abraham opened the session by situating India's AI journey within a broader regional and developmental context. Rather than centring the discussion on frontier model scale or capital intensity, he asked what distinctive contribution India brought to the global AI moment.

He highlighted India's digital public infrastructure as a foundational layer for AI deployment. Using DigiLocker's digitally signed QR architecture as an example, he illustrated how trusted, population-scale verification systems enabled scalable service delivery. He also referenced resource-efficient AI experimentation in India, including local language model development built with limited computational infrastructure, demonstrating frugal engineering outside hyperscale environments.

To illustrate AI's knowledge amplification potential, Abraham posed a thought experiment: how many primary school teachers could confidently explain the six schools of Hindu philosophy without preparation? He noted that leading AI systems could generate structured explanations instantly. His point was not replacement, but augmentation — positioning AI as a supplementary knowledge layer, particularly valuable in multilingual and resource-constrained contexts.

The panel discussion then moved to regional scalability. Prof. M. P. Gupta emphasised regulatory divergence and cross-border governance challenges that needed to be addressed before Indian AI systems could be replicated across South Asia. Alignment on data governance, compliance frameworks and institutional capacity was identified as critical for regional adoption.

Panellists also underscored the importance of building AI systems that functioned effectively on basic smartphones, low-bandwidth networks and in regional languages. India's experience designing for scale, affordability and diversity was framed as a transferable advantage for neighbouring economies.

In his concluding exchange, Abraham shifted the discussion from present deployments to long-term trajectory. He invited panellists to consider what meaningful AI leadership from India would look like over the next decade — whether influence would be measured in foundational model development, enterprise exports, regulatory standards, or tangible social outcomes.

The session positioned India's AI leadership not solely in terms of technical sophistication, but in its ability to combine digital public infrastructure, governance clarity and inclusive deployment to drive measurable social transformation.

## Responsible AI in Action: How Global Enterprises Are Building Trust at Scale (20 February 2026)

Sunil Abraham will speak at a session titled "Responsible AI in Action: How Global Enterprises Are Building Trust at Scale" on 20 February 2026 from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM at Bharat Mandapam, L1 Meeting Room No. 6.

The panel will examine approaches to responsible AI deployment at scale, focusing on how enterprises embed ethics, transparency and accountability into AI systems whilst balancing speed, compliance and innovation. Other scheduled speakers include Ankit Bose (Nasscom), Manish Gupta (Google DeepMind), Syed Ahmed (Infosys), and Geeta Gurnani (IBM). The session is being organised with Infosys Limited as knowledge partner.
