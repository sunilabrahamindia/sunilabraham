### Session A: Democratising AI Resources

The first session examines how business-driven AI, combined with India's digital public infrastructure, startup innovation and cloud-led enterprise transformation, can deliver inclusive and commercially viable social impact. The discussion highlights how scalable AI adoption across SMEs and startups can democratise AI resources, expand access to essential services and create equitable opportunities, whilst showcasing India's model of cross-border collaboration, inclusive AI use cases and knowledge sharing to drive regional empowerment and sustainable growth.

### Session B: India's AI Leadership as a Catalyst for Regional Social Transformation

Abraham will moderate the second session, which explores how India's AI leadership can deliver inclusive social-economic outcomes across South Asia by replicating India's digital public infrastructure, enterprise AI adoption and startup ecosystem through cross-border collaboration and knowledge sharing. The discussion positions AI for All as a scalable, impact-first, commercially viable business model for 1.4 billion people, driven by frugal AI solutions for basic smartphones, local languages and low-connectivity networks, catalysing financial inclusion, healthcare access, skills development, rural productivity and regional social empowerment.

The panel features Aditya Swamy (Managing Director, Play Partnerships, Google), Akhil Choudhary (CEO & Managing Partner, Highspring India), Anne Robinson (Sr Vice President & Chief Litigation Counsel, Dish Network Corporation) and Prof. M. P. Gupta (Director, IIM Lucknow).
