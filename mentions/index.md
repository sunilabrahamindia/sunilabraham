This page lists external mentions of the Sunil Abraham Project across newspapers, websites and encyclopaedias, reference sites, and other third-party sources.

The entries here are **not full article reproductions**. Instead, they serve as a structured citation layer, documenting where Sunil Abraham is referenced or discussed elsewhere on the internet.

Each entry records:
- the source publication or organisation,
- the title of the external page,
- the original URL (and archive link where available),
- the date on which the reference was last verified.

Where a full copy of an article or report exists on this site, it is archived separately under the appropriate section and not duplicated here.

## Notes on usage

- This list is maintained manually to ensure accuracy and longevity.
- Dates are included only when explicitly stated by the original source.
- Archive links are added where available to guard against link rot.
- Mentions may be linked to specific pages on this site as those pages are created and expanded.
