# The Sunil Abraham Project

Welcome to the documentation repository of Sunil Abraham.  
This project serves as an open collection of notes, essays, research material, and documentation, presented in a clear and accessible format.

The site is powered by **GitHub Pages** and primarily written in **Markdown**, with support for **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to enhance design and functionality.

## Purpose

- To preserve and publish documentation in a well-organised, readable form.  
- To use Markdown as the main markup language for simplicity and transparency.  
- To build and host the website freely using GitHub Pages.  
- To make the information publicly accessible and easy to maintain.
