The **Artificial Intelligence Portal** brings together Sunil Abraham's past and ongoing engagement with AI as a technological, social and political force. Rather than treating AI as a purely technical subject, this space documents how questions of power, governance, labour, bias, accountability and human agency emerge as AI systems are deployed at scale.

Over the years, Artificial Intelligence has appeared across Sunil Abraham's writing in different forms — as part of discussions on data governance, automation, surveillance, platform power, and institutional design. This portal consolidates those strands, making it easier to trace how ideas about AI have evolved alongside broader debates on digital rights, regulation and public interest technology.

In addition to archival material, the portal will gradually include project notes, analytical essays, short reflections and curated references that respond to contemporary developments in AI. These may range from policy interventions and public commentary to slower, reflective writing that examines how AI reshapes social relations, work, creativity and democratic processes.

As the collection grows, this portal will function both as an index to existing material and as a living workspace for future thinking on Artificial Intelligence within the wider Sunil Abraham Project.
