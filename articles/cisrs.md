The **Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society** (CISRS) is an ecumenical research centre focused on the study of religion and its interaction with public life in India. Its work examines how belief systems, social structures and political processes shape one another, particularly in the areas of caste, democracy, inter-faith relations and marginalised communities. The Institute was founded in 1957 in Bengaluru with support from the National Council of Churches in India (NCCI).

## History

CISRS was established in the context of post-Independence India, when several Christian scholars argued for a research institution that could analyse the country's social and religious changes. The Institute began operations in 1957 at 73, Miller's Road, Bengaluru, a location it continues to occupy.

Academic sources from the 1960s and 1990s acknowledge CISRS as one of the early organisations working at the intersection of religion and society in India. Some studies describe it as a Protestant initiative aimed at understanding how Christian thought relates to India's social and political environment.

Individuals involved in the founding included M. M. Thomas, P. D. Devanandan, R. B. Manickam, R. W. Scott, Chandran Devanesan, C. S. Paul, C. T. Kurien, A. K. Thampy, Leonardo Schiff, Winburn T. Thouburn, E. V. Mathew and Russel Chandran. A second unit, the South Asian Study and Research Centre in New Delhi, was later established for programmes and publications.

In its early period CISRS conducted studies on renascent Hindu movements and issues related to religious pluralism. During the 1970s, its work included responses to the political conditions surrounding the Emergency, with a focus on questions of citizenship and the role of the State. From the 1980s onwards, its research expanded to issues involving caste, gender and the experiences of Dalit and Adivasi communities.

## Objectives and Ideology

CISRS aims to provide research and analysis on religion and society in India. Its stated objectives include:

- Supporting churches and ecumenical bodies through research;  
- Encouraging dialogue across theology, the social sciences and public policy;  
- Addressing structural inequalities, including caste and gender;  
- Creating spaces where marginalised groups can articulate their perspectives.

Over time, commentators have described the Institute's work as moving towards what has been called a “secular theology of religions”, an approach that treats religion as a social and political force rather than focusing solely on doctrinal or devotional concerns. This shift allowed CISRS research to engage with caste discrimination, patriarchy, communal tensions and development policy.

## Inter-Faith Dialogue

Scholars associated with CISRS, including P. D. Devanandan, examined the development of modern Hindu movements and emerging religious trends in India. The Institute's work in this area emphasised engagement based on shared civic concerns instead of doctrinal comparisons. This approach influenced what later came to be termed the "dialogue of life", focusing on everyday coexistence between communities.

## Dalit Theology and Caste Studies

CISRS contributed to early research on caste within Christian and non-Christian contexts. Studies by researchers such as A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel examined folk practices, oral traditions and forms of cultural resistance found among Dalit communities. Independent theological literature identifies CISRS as one of several institutions involved in discussions that eventually shaped Dalit Theology.

## Gender and Women's Rights

Through programmes such as the Joint Women's Programme (JWP), CISRS engaged with questions relating to women's rights, family law and leadership in Christian contexts. Seminars, publications and collaborative research addressed the social and legal issues faced by women across denominations.

## Political Theology and Social Transformation

In the 1970s and 1980s CISRS was active in discussions on political theology, notably under the influence of M. M. Thomas. Its research during this period examined themes such as human rights, democratic participation and the ethical responsibilities of the State. Later surveys of Indian Christian thought identify this phase as one that shaped broader debates on the social role of religion.

## Notable Personalities

- P. D. Devanandan – early researcher on Hindu–Christian studies.  
- M. M. Thomas – writer and public thinker involved in political theology.  
- Saral K. Chatterji – sociologist working on caste and grassroots movements.  
- A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel – researcher of popular religion and caste practices.  
- Richard W. Taylor – scholar of Christian art and research methodologies.  

These names represent only a portion of those associated with the Institute's work.

## Publications

CISRS produces books, study papers and reports in the fields of religion and society. Its journal, *Religion and Society*, dates to the early 1950s and continues to publish articles on religious, social and political developments in India.

## Organisation and Centres

The Institute is registered under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act. Its principal office is located at Miller's Road, Bengaluru. The Delhi unit serves as a centre for programmes, consultations and research collaborations.

## Legacy

Academic surveys over several decades have noted CISRS as one of the institutions engaged in studying religion in relation to Indian society. Its work is referenced in discussions on caste, inter-faith relations, political theology and contextual theology in India. At the same time, some recent commentary raises questions about the long-term viability of Christian research institutions in India, including concerns related to funding and public engagement.
