The **Sunil Abraham Project** (abbreviated as **TSAP**) is a digital publishing, documenting, and archiving initiative founded by internet researcher and social entrepreneur Sunil Abraham in October 2025. Conceived as both a documentation framework and an experimental space, the project explores the scope of innovation in web-based archiving, accessible design, and content organisation. It was named by Tito Dutta, a former colleague and junior associate of Abraham, whose proposal aligned the title with the project's long-term vision of sustainability and digital continuity.

## History

The idea for the Sunil Abraham Project began to take shape in early 2025 from a need to create a unified digital space for preserving and presenting the diverse range of work produced by Sunil Abraham and his father, A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel, who was a prominent scholar and theologian. Before the project's establishment, Sunil's writings, policy papers, and media articles were scattered across various institutional and online platforms. The goal was to build a single, sustainable environment where this material could be archived, categorised, and accessed in a consistent format.

Throughout early and mid-2025, a number of informal discussions were held on how best to structure and preserve this work. Several potential names for the project were considered during this stage. Sunil suggested options such as AbrahamAyrookuzhiel.org and AMAAyrookuzhiel.org, while a few theme-based titles were also explored. Tito Dutta, a former colleague and junior associate, took part in these planning discussions and helped shape the project's conceptual direction. The domain name sunilabraham.in was purchased from BigRock on 27 September 2025, Mahapanchami, on the eve of Durga Puja.

The project gained momentum following a series of detailed WhatsApp exchanges between Sunil Abraham and Tito Dutta during the Durga Puja and Navratri period in September 2025. The site's name was proposed by Tito Dutta. During the planning discussions, he suggested a title that reflected the project's long-term vision and its commitment to sustainable, independent publishing. His proposal emphasised continuity and identity, aligning the name with the project's broader purpose of enduring digital documentation.

The Sunil Abraham Project was formally founded in October 2025, marking the beginning of its public development and the transition from concept to implementation.

### Announcement
On 13 November 2025 (Thursday), Sunil Abraham announced the launch of the project across his social platforms — sharing the update on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/abrahamsunil/posts/pfbid0h6kgb9kCKtHYmaWbyE7yNnmkS1hpdyz2yrghmA51dYMUotqQUCocrwvvRkB93CHil), posting it on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sunilaabraham_sunil-abraham-project-activity-7394691115444174848-2qbV/) and publishing a note on [𝕏](https://x.com/sunil_abraham/status/1988926639162683485) to mark the public launch of the initiative. The Facebook post received 138 likes and 5 shares, and the LinkedIn post drew even more attention with 183 likes. In contrast, the update on 𝕏 did not attract much engagement.

Several colleagues and long-time well-wishers also shared thoughtful responses. On Facebook, Ajai Narendran wrote that the project was "long due and much needed", describing it as a documentation effort that continues to inspire him with deep admiration and gratitude. Usha Raman commented that the initiative looked very interesting, and Ashish Kotamkar added that it was lovely and overdue. On LinkedIn, Shanty Mathew congratulated Sunil and noted that the project offered a useful repository and timeline of his public work. Anivar A Aravind recalled earlier moments from their shared professional journey — including meetings at IGF 2008 — and said it was encouraging to see the material brought together in one place.

## Design and Structure

The Sunil Abraham Project is developed on the Jekyll static site generator and hosted through GitHub Pages. The repository contains the complete build and configuration files. Using a static framework keeps the system straightforward: all content is generated from plain text files, managed through GitHub's version control, and published without the need for databases or dynamic scripts.

Page layouts across the site follow a defined pattern that balances readability and order. Most entries include sections such as Publication Details, Abstract, Context and Background, Key Themes or Findings, and External Links. This arrangement provides a uniform reading experience while allowing each document to retain its original context. Category and metadata tags link related pages together, forming an internal network of materials that can be browsed or indexed with ease.

In appearance, the site maintains a plain and accessible design. Text is prioritised over decorative elements, and layout decisions focus on spacing, type clarity, and colour contrast to support users with varied reading conditions. The visual approach remains consistent with accessibility guidelines and avoids unnecessary complexity. Files are organised within a category structure that separates different kinds of content, including Publications, Biographies, Media, and Project Pages. The site is automatically rebuilt with every update, using GitHub Pages to ensure version control and transparency in publication.
