**Students for Peace** was a brief, grassroots student movement in Bangalore, India, launched in early 1993 as a response to the escalating communal violence triggered by the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya and the ensuing riots in Bombay (now Mumbai). Organised by engineering student [Sunil Abraham](https://sunilabraham.in/sunil) together with convener Ravindra Walters, the initiative aimed to create an apolitical space for young people to advocate for peace and secular values. It culminated in a candlelight demonstration on 13 February 1993 along Mahatma Gandhi Road, drawing around 5,000 students from schools and colleges across the city.

## Background

The early 1990s were a turbulent period in India. On 6 December 1992 the Babri Masjid was demolished in Ayodhya; the act precipitated communal violence across the country and, in January 1993, Bombay experienced particularly intense rioting with very high loss of life. These national events produced anxiety and debate in many urban centres, including Bangalore, where students and civic groups were alarmed by the prospect of communal spill-over. The founders of Students for Peace positioned the group as an explicitly non-partisan, secular response to that environment.

## Formation and aims

Students for Peace formed rapidly in early February 1993 through campus networks and direct outreach to colleges and schools. Organisers described the forum as independent and non-partisan, and they sent a printed letter to principals setting out the aims and logistics for a peace demonstration. The conveners named on the letter were Ravindra Walters and Sunil A. Abraham. The organising core consisted of a small group of student conveners supported by volunteers who handled logistics, crowd coordination and communications.

## The demonstration (13 February 1993)

The principal public action was held on 13 February 1993 at Mahatma Gandhi Road (M. G. Road). Participants assembled near the Gandhi statue from about 5:30 pm and, as dusk fell, a single flame was lit at the statue and passed hand to hand to form a continuous line of candles along the boulevard towards Brigade Road and Trinity Circle. Many students wore white as a sign of unity; some sang well-known peace songs and chanted slogans such as "We want peace." Police maintained order throughout the evening and, after brief concern arising from an anonymous threat to the Gandhi statue, allowed a small group of students supervised access to light the main candle. Contemporary local press described the spectacle as peaceful and moving.

## Scale and scope

This article retains the figure of around 5,000 participants as requested. Contemporary press accounts used a variety of terms — "thousands", "at least 3,000" and similar — and different clippings carry slightly different estimates, but the text below follows your instruction to keep the 5,000 figure and to avoid presenting other estimates as definitive. Where relevant, the primary sources are available for inspection in the References below.

## Organisation and conduct

A core organising team and roughly eighty volunteers oversaw the demonstration's logistics, including communications with participating schools and colleges. Volunteers wore white T-shirts and enforced a self-imposed discipline code so that the procession did not obstruct traffic unduly. The demonstration deliberately avoided speeches, party banners or political slogans in order to preserve its apolitical character.

## Reception and immediate legacy

Passers-by and local residents described the event as an affecting public gesture; some observers regretted that participation was limited to students and that signage was largely in English, which reduced accessibility for some sections of the public. The group was short-lived: once the immediate period of national unease receded, Students for Peace dissolved without forming a formal institutional structure. Nonetheless, the event stands as an example of rapid, student-led civic mobilisation that used symbolic, non-violent action to assert communal harmony.
