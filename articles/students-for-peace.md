**Students for Peace** was a brief, grassroots student movement in Bangalore, India, launched in early 1993 as a response to the escalating communal violence triggered by the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya and the ensuing riots in Bombay (now Mumbai). Organised by engineering student [Sunil Abraham](https://sunilabraham.in/sunil), the initiative aimed to create an apolitical space for youth to advocate for peace and secular values, culminating in a large-scale candlelight demonstration that drew thousands of participants. Though short-lived, it exemplified early efforts by urban students to counter national unrest through non-violent solidarity.

## Background

The early 1990s marked a turbulent period in Indian history, with rising Hindu-Muslim tensions boiling over into widespread violence. On December 6, 1992, the Babri Masjid—a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh—was razed by Hindu nationalists, an act that ignited riots across the country. In the following weeks, Bombay saw some of the deadliest clashes, with over 900 people killed in January 1993 alone, according to official estimates from the Srikrishna Commission inquiry. These events reverberated far beyond northern India, stirring fears of communal discord in southern cities like Bangalore, which had largely escaped major outbreaks but grappled with polarized debates in schools and colleges.

It was against this backdrop that Sunil Abraham, then a second-year engineering student at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore university conceived Students for Peace. Abraham, who would later become a prominent figure in digital rights advocacy as executive director of the Centre for Internet and Society, drew on his campus networks to form the group. Described in his professional records as an "express apolitical and secular platform," it emphasized rapid mobilization without affiliation to any political party or religious group, focusing instead on fostering dialogue among diverse student communities.

## Formation and Activities

Students for Peace emerged spontaneously in the immediate aftermath of the Bombay riots, with Sunil taking a prominent role in coordinating volunteers from various educational institutions. The group's core activity was a single, symbolic event: a peaceful demonstration on Mahatma Gandhi Road (M. G. Road), one of Bangalore's busiest thoroughfares. On an unspecified date in early 1993—likely sometime between January and March, aligning with the peak of national tensions—around 5,000 students from colleges and schools gathered, each holding a lit candle to represent unity and non-violence.

The initiative's brevity—lasting only weeks—stemmed from its ad hoc nature; once the immediate threat subsided, the group dissolved, leaving no formal structure or ongoing programs. Yet, its model of student-driven, candlelit protests echoed in later Indian movements, from anti-corruption rallies to environmental marches.
