### Snake bite incident

In February 2021, Herbert Paul was bitten by a Russell's viper whilst performing at a microbrewery on Hennur Road. The incident occurred during a Tuesday night performance when the snake bit him in the leg before slithering away. He was admitted to the intensive care unit at Baptist Hospital, where doctors monitored him for cardiac fluctuations, a common effect of Russell's viper venom. He subsequently recovered following treatment.


## Influence and mentorship

Herbert Paul's influence extended beyond formal roles and was particularly evident in his mentorship of younger members of the Church community. Those who worked closely with him during their formative years have noted his role in shaping both creative and technical skills.

Sunil Abraham, who participated alongside Herbert in Sunday School and Youth Fellowship activities, has described Herbert as a friend and mentor during this period. According to Abraham, Herbert introduced him to graphic design and desktop publishing through their collaborative work on the Church newsletter, while also modelling a multidisciplinary approach that combined music, teaching, and creative production.

Through this informal mentorship, Herbert played a part in passing on practical skills in visual design, publishing, and music, alongside a collaborative ethic rooted in community-based creative work.

## Association with Wesley English Church, Bengaluru

Herbert Paul has had a long and active association with Wesley English Church, Bengaluru, particularly through its Sunday School and Youth Fellowship activities. His involvement combined music, creative work, teaching support, and organisational leadership across several decades.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Herbert became involved with the Church's Sunday School, contributing primarily as a guitarist. After Kenny Elisha left due to professional commitments, Herbert worked alongside [Sunil Abraham](/sunil/) in supporting the Sunday School's worship and creative programmes. Together, they scripted plays and composed original music under the guidance of Mrs. Karat. In 1994, the Sunday School participated in a two-day Inter–Sunday School Competition involving forty Churches and won prizes for both singing and drama, with both entries being original compositions.

Following a period of decline in attendance, concern from the Church leadership led to Herbert being asked to take charge of the Sunday School. Along with his wife, Bindu Paul, and with support from Anne Margaret, he played a central role in reviving the programme, with music serving as a key focus of this renewal.

He later composed music for major productions, including the Christmas musical staged in 2006, scripted by Kenny Elisha. In 2007, at the request of the Presbyter-in-charge, Rev. Mitra, Herbert helped form and train a children's praise and worship band. During this period, the Sunday School also hosted the first Vacation Bible School conducted at Wesley English Church and within the Karnataka Central Diocese.

In parallel, Herbert was actively involved in the Youth Fellowship of Wesley English Church. In 1990, he was part of the team that founded the Church magazine *Voice*, where he handled design, printing, and visual layout, including a regular cartoon feature. His work supported the publication's transition from letterpress to digital production methods.
