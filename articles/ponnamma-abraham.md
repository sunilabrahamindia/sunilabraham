## Early life and Education

Ponnamma Abraham (née Ponnamma Thekedath) was born on Saturday, 17 June 1944. In 1965, she went to Bonn Venusberg to pursue additional nursing training at the Universitätskliniken.

It was around the end of 1965 or sometime in 1966 that she met Athanasius Mathen Abraham Ayrookuzhiel for the first time in Bonn. He was travelling from Rome to England for further studies and had stopped in Bonn to apply for a visa. He sent her a telegram saying he would be arriving, and she went to the railway station to meet him, accompanied by someone who came along to help. By then, he had already spent about two years in Rome.

## Career

After completing her nursing training at the Universitätskliniken in Bonn Venusberg, she moved to the United Kingdom to begin her professional work. She served at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading and later at Mints Hospital in Reading, gaining experience across different clinical departments.

When she returned to India in 1973, she joined the United Theological College Nursery School in Bangalore. Over the years, she took on increasing responsibility at the institution and eventually retired as its Principal.

## Personal life

On 20 April 1971, she married Athanasius Mathen Abraham Ayrookuzhiel (A. M. A. Ayrookuzhiel) at the Catholic Church in Königsdorf, near Munich in what was then West Germany. Their engagement took place in September 1970 at the Werner Lehmann family home in the Black Forest (Schwarzwald). They had three sons: Sunil Abraham (born 17 June 1973), Matthew Abraham (born 3 January 1976), and Jacob Abraham (born 5 March 1980). Jacob married Vini Susan on 7 January 2012. Over the years, the family kept strong ties with both Kerala and Bangalore, staying connected to relatives, local congregations, and the communities where Ayrookuzhiel had spent his life and work. She currently resides in Bangalore.
