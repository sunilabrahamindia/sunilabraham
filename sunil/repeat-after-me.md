**"Repeat after me"** is a series of tweets posted on 24 February 2017 by [Sunil Abraham](/sunil) on X (then known as Twitter). The posts formed a short, thematically linked sequence criticising the design, security assumptions and surveillance implications of India's Aadhaar biometric identification system.

Each tweet began with the phrase "Repeat after me", followed by a concise statement addressing issues such as biometric authentication, centralised databases, cryptographic safeguards and the distinction between identification and authentication. The repetition functioned as a rhetorical device, framing the thread as both critique and instruction. A standalone reply extending the series was posted on 7 April 2017 in response to a broader conversation on the platform.

The series emerged during a period of heightened public debate over Aadhaar, including litigation before the Supreme Court of India, policy disputes concerning mandatory linkage, and wider civil society concerns about privacy, proportionality and data protection. The tweets were part of a broader body of commentary by Abraham on technology governance, digital identity systems and surveillance architecture.

The phrase has since been associated with Sunil Abraham's public communication on Aadhaar, reflecting a style that combined technical argument with direct, replicable messaging.

### Aadhaar and biometric authentication

Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to residents of India. The system collects biometric data — including fingerprints and iris scans — alongside demographic information, and uses these to verify identity during transactions. The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016, passed in the Lok Sabha on 12 March 2016, gave the programme legislative backing and expanded its use across government services and subsidy delivery.

Critics from the technology and civil liberties communities argued that the system's architecture was structurally flawed. Concerns centred on the irreversibility of biometric compromise, the absence of meaningful consent during authentication, and the creation of a centralised database of sensitive personal data. Security professionals noted that, unlike passwords or tokens, biometric identifiers cannot be reissued once stolen.

### Legal and policy context (2016–2017)

By 2017, Aadhaar faced mounting legal scrutiny before the Supreme Court of India. Petitions challenged its constitutional validity, particularly on grounds of the right to privacy. During this period, arguments advanced by the government concerning the constitutional status of the right to privacy attracted public and academic scrutiny.

The period from 2016 to 2017 also saw expanding mandatory linkage requirements — Aadhaar was progressively linked to bank accounts, mobile numbers, tax filings, and welfare schemes — which intensified public debate over consent, exclusion, and surveillance.

### Sunil Abraham's prior commentary on Aadhaar

Sunil Abraham, co-founder and then Executive Director of the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), had been a leading voice in debates over Aadhaar well before the February 2017 tweets. In a March 2016 interview with *Business Standard*, he described Aadhaar as "surveillance technology disguised as developmental intervention" and argued that biometrics used for identification constituted covert surveillance, citing the ease with which iris data could be captured remotely without consent. He also warned that maintaining a central biometric repository created an irreversible security risk — a "honey pot" that would inevitably attract attack.

Abraham had served as a member of the Justice A. P. Shah Committee on privacy, which produced India's first comprehensive privacy framework recommendations. His commentary on Aadhaar drew on this background in data protection policy, combining technical critique with an institutional understanding of how legal frameworks fail to protect citizens when the government itself holds their data.

## Tweet Series

### 24 February 2017 thread

On 24 February 2017, Abraham posted a sequence of six short statements on X (then known as Twitter), each opening with the phrase "Repeat after me." The tweets addressed distinct but interrelated aspects of the Aadhaar system, moving from broad architectural critique to specific claims about authentication design and institutional practice. In chronological order based on tweet status IDs, the thread ran as follows:

The thread was not formally labelled as a series; the structural unity came entirely from the shared opening phrase and the common subject. Each statement stood independently, yet together they built a layered argument spanning authentication design, biometric vulnerability, database security, and institutional contradiction.

### 7 April 2017 reply

On 7 April 2017, Abraham returned to the lead statement in a reply to users [@SKisContent](https://x.com/SKisContent) and [@AnujSrivas](https://x.com/AnujSrivas), repeating verbatim: *"Repeat after me: Aadhaar is surveillance technology masquerading as secure authentication technology."* The reply extended the series into a separate conversation thread, suggesting the phrase had taken on a reusable, almost formulaic quality in Abraham's public communication on the subject. Anuj Srivas was at the time a journalist covering technology and policy, and the context indicates the phrase was being invoked in response to an ongoing media discussion about Aadhaar's design and security claims.

### Prior context: October 2016

Before the February 2017 thread, Abraham had already been communicating on the subject in public forums. On 17 October 2016, he shared a recorded talk titled *"Aadhaar by Numbers"* on Twitter, addressed to those unfamiliar with the system under the hashtag [#FriendWithoutAadhaar](https://x.com/hashtag/FriendWithoutAadhaar), in which he examined Aadhaar's technical architecture from a critical perspective. This suggests the February 2017 tweets were a compressed, more direct reformulation of arguments Abraham had been developing through lectures and written commentary over the preceding year.

## Themes

### Surveillance and identification

A central argument running through the thread is the distinction between identification and authentication. Abraham contended that Aadhaar, despite being presented as an authentication system, functioned primarily as an identification technology — one capable of locating and recognising individuals without their active knowledge or cooperation. In his *Frontline* cover story published on 30 March 2016, he had defined biometrics as "non-consensual and covert identification technology," noting that high-resolution cameras could capture fingerprints and iris scans remotely, enabling identification without the subject's awareness. The lead tweet — "Aadhaar is surveillance technology masquerading as secure authentication technology" — distilled this argument into a single, replicable sentence.

This framing challenged the government's consistent positioning of Aadhaar as a tool for delivering welfare efficiently. Abraham argued in a March 2016 *Business Standard* interview that the system "identifies people without their consent and authenticates transactions on their behalf," making citizens transparent to the state whilst rendering the state opaque and unaccountable in return. The tweet series presented these arguments in a more compressed and direct form, without the extended technical discussion found in Abraham's longer essays and interviews.

### Centralised databases and security risk

The fourth tweet in the sequence — "All centralised databases are honey pots. They will be breached. Only question is when" — addressed the structural security risk of housing biometric records for over a billion people in a single centralised system. Abraham had developed this argument in detail in his published writing, comparing the Aadhaar database with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica episode: in both cases, he observed, the breach did not require a direct compromise of the central database but rather exploited legitimate access mechanisms through third-party integrators or API abuse. His conclusion, stated in an *Economic Times* report, was that "it was a legitimate means of access through API that was open for abuse."

The honey pot metaphor reflected arguments Abraham had developed in earlier essays and interviews concerning centralised database risk. Sunil argued in his January 2018 *Business Standard* column ["Fixing Aadhaar"](/publications/fixing-aadhaar-security-developers-task-is-to-trim-chances-of-data-breach/) that the solution lay in tokenisation — replacing the Aadhaar number itself with a system-generated token in downstream transactions, so that banks, telecom firms, and service providers never held the actual biometric identifier. This proposal, he noted, would eliminate the incentive for large-scale aggregation of Aadhaar-linked records across databases.

### Biometrics and authentication

Two tweets in the sequence addressed biometric technology specifically, targeting the assumption that biometrics are inherently more secure than conventional authentication methods. The tweet "Biometrics can be defeated by every citizen in the country using fevicol and wax" made the practical point that fingerprint sensors — the primary biometric modality used in Aadhaar authentication — could be spoofed using widely available materials. This was not a novel claim; security researchers had demonstrated fingerprint spoofing for years, but the tweet brought the argument to a general audience in direct, accessible language.

The sixth tweet sharpened the contradiction further: "If biometrics is so safe why is the UIDAI using cryptography for security." Abraham had made this argument in his published work as well, noting that the actual security of the Aadhaar system rested on cryptographic protocols rather than biometric uniqueness. Biometrics served as a means of linking a person to a record; cryptography protected the transmission and storage of that record. Conflating the two, he argued, created a false sense of security around the biometric component whilst obscuring the risks inherent in the centralised architecture. His TSAP profile notes that his work at CIS consistently combined technical argument with an institutional understanding of how legal frameworks fail to protect citizens when the government itself holds their data.

### Rhetorical structure

The phrase "Repeat after me" speaks directly to the reader, framing each statement not as an argument to be weighed but as a conclusion already established, requiring only repetition. The structure presented each statement as a settled conclusion rather than a detailed argument requiring elaboration within the tweet itself.

Each tweet was designed to stand alone as a shareable unit whilst contributing to a cumulative argument when read in sequence. This format suited the platform's architecture: individual tweets could be shared by users who found a single point compelling, without requiring engagement with the full thread. Global Voices noted the lead tweet specifically when covering the broader campaign of online trolling directed at Aadhaar critics in mid-2017. The series thus functioned simultaneously as public education, political communication, and a template for others to repeat and amplify.

## Reception

### Media coverage

The lead tweet from the series — "Repeat after me: Aadhaar is surveillance technology masquerading as secure authentication technology" — was quoted directly by *Global Voices Advox* in two reports published in May 2017. In a 4 May 2017 report titled ["Is India's Aadhaar System an Instrument For Surveillance?"](https://advox.globalvoices.org/2017/05/05/is-indias-aadhaar-system-an-instrument-for-surveillance/), the publication cited the tweet as part of its examination of expert opinion on Aadhaar's surveillance architecture, placing Abraham's statement alongside commentary from lawyers, technologists, and parliamentarians. The piece noted that Abraham, as Executive Director of CIS, had "openly described Aadhaar as a surveillance tool."

A second *Global Voices Advox* report, published on 31 May 2017 and titled ["Online Trolls Attack Critics of India's Aadhaar State ID System"](https://advox.globalvoices.org/2017/05/31/online-trolls-attack-critics-of-indias-aadhaar-state-id-system/), again quoted the tweet at the top of its report. The article documented a coordinated campaign of anonymous trolling directed at Aadhaar critics in the weeks following the CIS data leak revelations of May 2017. The report noted that CIS had by then become a specific target of what it described as "the pro-Aadhaar lobby," and quoted Abraham's tweet as part of its coverage of the debate. The same report documented Abraham's response to an apology later issued by iSPIRT co-founder Sharad Sharma, who had been identified as the operator of anonymous troll accounts targeting Aadhaar critics.

### Social media circulation

The tweet series appeared during a period of intense activity on Indian social media around Aadhaar. By February 2017, debates over mandatory Aadhaar linkage, biometric data leaks, and the government's legal position on privacy had drawn a wide range of participants onto the platform, including lawyers, journalists, technologists, and civil society researchers. The "Repeat after me" format aligned with the conventions of the platform: each statement was short enough to share without context, specific enough to anchor discussion, and direct enough to function as a clearly stated position.

The series was referenced in reporting on organised online pushback against Aadhaar critics. *Global Voices* reported that "sock puppet" accounts with "fewer followers than tweets" were systematically targeting those who criticised Aadhaar on social media. Sunil's tweets formed part of the wider online discourse referenced in coverage of this period.

## Significance

The tweet series appeared at a critical point in India's Aadhaar debate. In August 2017, the Supreme Court unanimously recognised privacy as a fundamental right, and the subsequent 2018 Aadhaar judgment saw Justice D. Y. Chandrachud's dissent invoke language — "informational self-determination," "surveillance infrastructure" — that closely mirrored arguments Abraham had been making in technical terms since 2016.

Within Abraham's own output, the series is notable for its compression. Where his essays reached specialist audiences, the tweet format carried the same conclusions to a broader readership. The lead statement became one of the more widely cited formulations associated with his commentary on Aadhaar, quoted by international publications including *Global Voices* across multiple reports in 2017.
